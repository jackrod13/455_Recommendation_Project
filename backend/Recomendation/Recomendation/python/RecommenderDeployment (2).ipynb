Migration of Billing infrastructure from Netflix Data Center(DC) to AWS Cloud was part of a broader initiative. This prior blog post is a great read that summarizes our strategic goals and direction towards AWS migration. For a company, its billing solution is its financial lifeline, while at the same time, it is a visible representation of a company's attitude towards its customers. A great customer experience is one of Netflix's core values. Considering the sensitive nature of Billing for its direct impact on our monetary relationship with our members as well on financial reporting, this migration needed to be handled as delicately as possible. Our primary goal was to define a secure, resilient and granular path for migration to the Cloud, without impacting the member experience. This blog entry discusses our approach to migration of a complex Billing ecosystem from Netflix Data Center(DC) into AWS Cloud. Components of our Billing architecture Billing infrastructure is responsible for managing the billing state of Netflix members. This includes keeping track of open/paid billing periods, the amount of credit on the member's account, managing payment status of the member, initiating charge requests and what date the member has paid through. Other than these, billing data feeds into financial systems for revenue and tax reporting for Netflix accounting. To accomplish above, billing engineering encompasses: Batch jobs to create recurring renewal orders for a global subscriber base, aggregated data feeds into our General Ledger(GL) for daily revenue from all payment methods including gift cards, Tax Service that reads from and posts into Tax engine. Generation of messaging events and streaming/DVD hold events based on billing state of customers. Billing APIs provide billing and gift card details to the customer service platform and website. Other than these, Billing APIs are also part of workflows initiated to process user actions like member signup, change plan, cancellation, update address, chargebacks, and refund requests. Integrations with different services like member account service, payment processing, customer service, customer messaging, DVD website and shipping Billing systems had integrations in DC as well as in cloud with the cloud-native systems. At a high level, our pre-migration architecture could be abstracted out as below:- Considering how much code and data was interacting with Oracle, one of our objectives was to disintegrate our giant Oracle based solution into a services based architecture. Some of our APIs needed to be multi-region and highly available. So we decided to split our data into multiple data stores. Subscriber data was migrated to Cassandra data store. Our payment processing integration needed ACID transaction. Hence all relevant data was migrated to MYSQL. Following is a representation of our post migration architecture. As we approached the mammoth task of migration, we were keenly aware of the many challenges in front of us ... Our migration should ideally not take any downtime for user facing flows. Our new architecture in AWS would need to scale to rapidly growing the member base. We had billions of rows of data, constantly changing and composed of all the historical data since Netflix's inception in 1997. It was growing every single minute in our large shared database on Oracle. To move all this data over to AWS, we needed to first transport and synchronize the data in real time, into a double digit Terabyte RDBMS in cloud. Being a SOX system added another layer of complexity, since all the migration and tooling needed to adhere to our SOX processes. Netflix was launching in many new countries and marching towards being global soon. Billing migration needed to happen without adversely impacting other teams that were busy with their own migration and global launch milestones. Our approach to migration was guided by simple principles that helped us in defining the way forward. We will cover the most important ones below: Challenge complexity and simplify: It is much easier to simply accept complexity inherent in legacy systems than challenge it, though when you are floating in a lot of data and code, simplification becomes the key. It seemed very intimidating until we spent a few days opening up everything and asking ourselves repeatedly about how else we could simplify. Cleaning up Code : We started chipping away existing code into smaller, efficient modules and first moved some critical dependencies to run from the Cloud. We moved our tax solution to the Cloud first. Next, we retired serving member billing history from giant tables that were part of many different code paths. We built a new application to capture billing events, migrated only necessary data into our new Cassandra data store and started serving billing history, globally, from the Cloud. We spent a good amount of time writing a data migration tool that would transform member billing attributes spread across many tables in Oracle into a much simpler Cassandra data structure. We worked with our DVD engineering counterparts to further simplify our integration and got rid of obsolete code. Purging Data : We took a hard look at every single table to ensure that we were migrating only what we needed and leaving everything else behind. Historical billing data is valuable to legal and customer service teams. Our goal was to migrate only necessary data into the Cloud. So, we worked with impacted teams to find out what parts of historical data they really needed. We identified alternative data stores that could serve old data for these teams. After that, we started purging data that was obsolete and was not needed for any function. Build tooling to be resilient and compliant : Our goal was to migrate applications incrementally with zero downtime. To achieve this, we built proxies and redirectors to pipe data back into DC. This helped us in keeping our applications in DC , unimpacted by the change, till we were ready to migrate them. We had to build tooling in order to support our Billing Cloud infrastructure which needed to be SOX compliant. For SOX compliance we needed to ensure mitigation of unexpected developer actions and auditability of actions. Our Cloud deployment tool was enhanced to capture details of deployment and pipe events to and our Big Data Platform for auditability. We needed to enhance Cassandra client for authentication and auditable actions. We wrote new alerts using that would help us in monitoring our applications and data in the Cloud. With the help of our Data analytics team, we built a comparator to reconcile subscriber data in Cassandra datastore against data in Oracle by country and report mismatches. To achieve the above, we heavily used Netflix big data platform to capture deployment events, used sqoop to transport data from our Oracle database and Cassandra clusters to Hive. We wrote Hive queries and MapReduce jobs for needed reports and dashboards. Test with a clean and limited dataset first. How global expansion helped us : As Netflix was launching in new countries, it created a lot of challenges for us, though it also provided an opportunity to test our Cloud infrastructure with new, clean data, not weighted down by legacy. So, we created a new skinny billing infrastructure in Cloud, for all the user facing functionality and a skinny version of our renewal batch process, with integration into DC applications, to complete the billing workflow. Once the data for new countries could be successfully processed in the Cloud, it gave us the confidence to extend the Cloud footprint for existing large legacy countries, especially the US, where we support not only streaming but DVD billing as well. Decouple user facing flows to shield customer experience from downtimes or other migration impacts : As we were getting ready to migrate existing members' data into Cassandra, we needed downtime to halt processing while we migrated subscription data from Oracle to Cassandra for our APIs and batch renewal in Cloud. All our tooling was built around ability to migrate a country at time and tunnel traffic as needed. We worked with ecommerce and membership services to change integration in user workflows to an asynchronous model. We built retry capabilities to rerun failed processing and repeat as needed. We added optimistic customer state management to ensure our members were not penalized while our processing was halted. By doing all the above, we transformed and moved millions of rows from Oracle in DC to Cassandra in AWS without any obvious user impact. Moving a database needs its own strategic planning : Database movement needs to be planned out while keeping the end goal in sight, or else it can go very wrong. There are many decisions to be made, from storage prediction to absorbing at least a year's worth of growth in data that translates into number of instances needed, licensing costs for both production and test environments, using RDS services vs. managing larger EC2 instances, ensuring that database architecture can address scalability, availability and reliability of data. Creating disaster recovery plan, planning minimal migration downtime possible and the list goes on. As part of this migration, we decided to migrate from licenced Oracle to open source MYSQL database running on Netflix managed EC2 instances. While our subscription processing was using data in our Cassandra datastore, our payment processor needed ACID capabilities of an RDBMS to process charge transactions. We still had a multi-terabyte database that would not fit in AWS RDS with TB limitations. With the help of Netflix platform core and database engineering, we defined a multi-region, scalable architecture for our MYSQL master with DRBD copy and multiple read replicas available in different regions. We also moved all our ETL processing to replicas to avoid resource contention on the Master. Database Cloud Engineering built tooling and alerts for MYSQL instances to ensure monitoring and recovery as needed. Our other biggest challenge was migrating constantly changing data to MYSQL in AWS, without taking any downtime. After exploring many options, we proceeded with Oracle GoldenGate, which could replicate our tables across heterogeneous databases, along with ongoing incremental changes. Of course, this was a very large movement of data, that ran in parallel to our production operations and other migration for a couple of months. We conducted iterative testing and issue fixing cycles to run our applications against MYSQL. Eventually, many weeks before flipping the switch, we started running our test database on MYSQL and would fix and test all issues on MYSQL code branch before doing a final validation on Oracle and releasing in production. Running our test environment against MYSQL continuously created a great feedback loop for us. Finally, on January 4, with a flip of a switch, we were able to move our processing and data ETLs against MYSQL. While our migration to the Cloud was relatively smooth, looking back, there are always a few things we could have done better. We underestimated testing automation needs. We did not have a good way to test end to end flows. Having spent enough effort on these aspects, upfront, would have given us better developer velocity. Migrating something as critical as billing with scale and legacy that needed to be addressed was plenty of work, though the benefits from the migration and simplification are also numerous. Post migration, we are more efficient and lighter in our software footprint than before. We are able to fully utilize Cloud capabilities in tooling, alerting and monitoring provided by the Netflix platform services. Our applications are able to scale horizontally as needed, which has helped us in keeping up our processing with subscriber growth. In conclusion, billing migration was a major cross functional engineering effort. Different engineering teams: core platform, security, database engineering, tooling, big data platform, business teams and other engineering teams supported us through this. We plan to cover focused topics on database migration and engineering perspectives as a continuing series of blog posts in the future. Once in the Cloud, we now see numerous opportunities to further enhance our services by using innovations of AWS and the Netflix platform. Netflix being global is bringing many more interesting challenges to our path. We have started our next big effort to re-architect our billing platform to become even more efficient and distributed for a global subscriber scale.

              "text          All of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. \"Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution - the most elegant solution we have seen to date,\" said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft's work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together - somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users. Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system - known as an Ether - that people have recently been buying. The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, \"Blockchain: Tapping I nto the Real Potential , Cutting Through the Hype.\" Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain. Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress's investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a \"significant\" purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry's chatter about the virtual currency has evolved. \"A lot of the more established players were thinking, 'It's still an experiment,' \" he said. \"It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.\" Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week. Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario. The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain - the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source - say, The Associated Press - the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet. The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether. A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin's team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software's development. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers - or nodes - helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. One of Mr. Buterin's co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing. The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around. Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets. \"Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,\" he said. Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin. It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned. \"Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,\" Mr. Bonneau said. \"It will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.\"  \\\n",

              "text          All of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. \"Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution - the most elegant solution we have seen to date,\" said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft's work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together - somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users. Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system - known as an Ether - that people have recently been buying. The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, \"Blockchain: Tapping I nto the Real Potential , Cutting Through the Hype.\" Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain. Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress's investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a \"significant\" purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry's chatter about the virtual currency has evolved. \"A lot of the more established players were thinking, 'It's still an experiment,' \" he said. \"It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.\" Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week. Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario. The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain - the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source - say, The Associated Press - the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet. The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether. A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin's team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software's development. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers - or nodes - helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. One of Mr. Buterin's co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing. The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around. Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets. \"Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,\" he said. Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin. It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned. \"Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,\" Mr. Bonneau said. \"It will depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual application.\"  \\\n",

              "text          The alarm clock wakes me at 8:00 with stream of advert-free broadcasting, charged at one satoshi per second. The current BTC exchange rate makes that snooze button a costly proposition! So I get up, make coffee and go to my computer to check the overnight performance of my bots. TradeBot earns me on Trump and Branson TradeBot, which allocates funds between the main chain and various national currency side-chains, generated a lucrative 0.24 BTC return. TradeBot has been reliably profitable ever since I set it to trade USDcoin according to political prediction market data. As expected, the latest poll numbers came in as highly supportive of Trump's re-election as USDcoin CEO. Trump's resistance to de-anonymizing public spending, by moving USDcoin off the Confidential Transactions layer, continues to erode his coin's credibility. In his latest speech, Trump maintains that full CT-privacy is essential to \"combatting CNYcoin's sinister ring-signature scheming.\" I make a note to increase my long position in GBPcoin. Following CEO Branson's memo to the effect that government finances and national banks be brought into compliance with the public blockchain , British corruption indices have flatlined. As the first national econmy to \"go light,\" Britain leads the global recovery from the Great Debt Default of '20. Happy with the GoatData Project I check TeachBot and note that it's performing in-line with expectations. TeachBot serves as an autonomous info-agent between various contracting AIs and data providers. The 0.5 BTC bounty it awarded to a team of Sherpas to outfit a herd of Tibetan mountain goats with full motion-sensing rigs has already been repaid...I check the latest figures... four times over!

              "text          We're excited to share the Google Data Center 360° Tour - a YouTube 360° video that gives you an unprecedented and immersive look inside one of our data centers. There are several ways to view this video: On desktop using Google Chrome use your mouse or trackpad to change your view while the video plays YouTube app on mobile - move your device around to look at all angles while the video plays And the most immersive way to view - using Google Cardboard (currently supported by the Android YouTube app only, iOS support is coming soon!) Load the video in the YouTube app and tap on the Cardboard icon when the video starts to play. Insert your phone in Cardboard and look around. A little background . . . Several months ago, those of us on the Google Cloud Developer Advocacy Team had a rare opportunity to tour the Google data center in The Dalles, Oregon. Many of us had seen other non-Google data centers in our careers, but this experience was beyond anything we ever imagined. We were blown away by the scale, the incredible attention to security and privacy, and the amazing efforts to make the data center extremely efficient and green. Additionally, we were proud to meet some of the brilliant people that design, build and maintain these data centers. If you are a Google Cloud Platform customer, then this is your data center as much as it is our data center, so we want you to experience what we experienced.

              "text          The Aite Group projects the blockchain market could be valued at $400 million by 2019. For that reason, some of the biggest names in banking, industry and technology have entered into the space to evaluate how this technology could change the financial world. IBM and Linux, for instance, have brought together some of the brightest minds in the industry and technology to work on blockchain technology through the Hyperledger Project. The Hyperledger Project is under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, and seeks to incorporate findings by blockchain projects such as Blockstream, Ripple, Digital Asset Holdings and others in order to make blockchain technology useful for the world's biggest corporations. IBM has also contributed its own code to the project. According to John Wolpert, IBM's Global Blockchain Offering Director, when IBM and Linux began working together on the blockchain project, Linux made clear it wanted to \"disrupt the disruption,\" in part with their findings, as well as the data gathered by projects such as Ripple, Ethereum and others exploring the blockchain. The Linux foundation announced its Hyperledger project on December 17, 2015. Just one day later, 2,300 companies had requested to join. The second-largest open source foundation in the history of open source had only 450 inquiries. \"So, it's either going to be a holy mess or it's going to change the world,\" Wolpert said at The Blockchain Conference in San Francisco presented by Lighthouse Partners. As Wolford puts it, a team of IBMers is \"on a quest\" to understand and \"do something important\" with blockchain technology. \"I don't know why we got this rap in the '70s, way back, that we are not cool, that we're kind of stodgy, and that is not the IBM of my experience,\" Wolpert, who founded the taxi service Flywheel, explained. \"We're the original crazy people. The craziest people are the guys at IBM in the '60s and '70s -- you can imagine what they were doing in the '60s -- they are wild-eyed revolutionaries.\" Although this is not the image IBM markets, their work in quantum computing, quantum teleportation and neuro semantic chips count among some of the \"cool stuff\" IBM does, says Wolpert. IBM also approaches projects in the spirit of open innovation, and not proprietarily. \"Our method of operations is open, and it's often our MO to back not-our-thing,\" he said of IBM since the 1990s. Wolpert cites Java as one such project: \"You would not know about Java today if it weren't for IBM.\" As a \"pretty young dude,\" Wolpert was in the room when IBM made a billion-dollar decision to back Linux over its own technology. He also cites IBM's work on XML as an example of IBM's dedication to open innovation. Currently, IBM has employees working on crypto-security and distributed systems who have been working on consensus algorithms for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. \"They're crazy smart, we're planetary, we've gone from a couple of guys in a canoe, to a platoon and approaching an army of people working on blockchain,\" Wolpert said. \"So it feels a lot like my first job at IBM which was making Java real for business.\" This has led old and new friends to contact the the multinational technology and consulting corporation. \"Banks who have been calling us constantly ... saying 'What's your view on blockchain?' or 'Hey, let's do a project together on blockchain,'\" Wolpert said. \"We've been doing all these crazy projects on blockchain, every kind of blockchain, and learning a lot, been doing that for a couple years and really started to accelerate last year.\" Today, there is a whole unit dedicated to blockchain technology at Linux Foundation. \"We went all-in on blockchain,\" he explained. What's it all about for Wolpert? \"It's about evolving the Internet.\" Bitcoin is important for moving money around without a single authority. \"[Bitcoin] is a solution to a problem, a specific problem, of people who need to move money around in environments where you don't trust the government,\" Wolpert said. \"I think we can all agree we are approaching the end of the era where a single authority manages trust and gets compensated for the risk in doing so.\" In Wolpert's view, finance does not need to go from today's system of trust -- where consumers trust institutions to handle their money -- to one of complete trustlessness, like the Bitcoin system in which a protocol, not a centralized authority, manages the movement of value. \"It doesn't follow, having one single trust authority to trustlessness on everything,\" he said. \"There is a false dichotomy between the notion of trust and trustlessness, that you have to have a walled garden on one side and Bitcoin on the other.\" He doesn't compare Bitcoin to the Internet, saying that's a wrong analogy. \"It is not apt to say the Internet is like Bitcoin; the Internet is, from the perspective of Bitcoin, a permissioned walled garden,\" he said. \"Ever heard of ICANN? It's permissive, but it's permissioned.\" Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum are \"Iteration 1\" of blockchain technology, the three time IBMer told his audience. Wolpert thinks blockchain technology will soon evolve to \"Iteration 2.\" The problem with it? \"The Internet is constrained,\" Wolpert said. \"You have a fabric that allows for lots of competition on platforms and huge amounts of competition on solutions and applications on top of it, so we need to evolve the Internet to become economically aware, and that Internet isn't going to be an application, it is going to be a fabric and then lots of applications on top of that.\" This doesn't mean blockchain 2.0 technologies such as Blockstream, Ethereum and Ripple are lost causes that must now completely retool. The Linux Foundation, in fact, works with Ethereum and Ripple employees. With its blockchain projects, IBM is not focused on moving a cryptocurrency. \"Lots of banks pay us lots of money and we like that, and we want to radically improve them,\" Wolpert explained. \"[Bankers] are gonna try like heck to radically improve what is going on ahead of the disruption, disrupt themselves if you will. If you look at things like [Overstock's] t0, that's happening, might happen on Bitcoin protocol, but might not, and there's plenty of ways to solve it, when you commit to it. And sure, Bitcoin has woken [banks] up to this, so it's doing its job, it's disrupting the thinking and maybe that is all that is necessary.\" Wolpert wonders aloud during his speech if the world would have iTunes were it not for Napster, or Netflix if it weren't for BitTorrent. The former head of products for IBM's Watson Ecosystem says IBM currently has a \"boomtown with giant numbers of people at IBM and everywhere else\" investigating the blockchain problem and how distributed technology can be made useful for industry. He details how oftentimes IBM tinkers with open innovations itself to make the technology ready for industry. That's not the route being taken with Bitcoin. That the Bitcoin network is on par with Ireland for energy consumption, and that mining consortiums could eventually dictate that market, scares the firm away from dealing directly with Bitcoin. \"What I want to see, what we want to see, is a world full of companies who I can know, who I can identify, who are so spread out, like the Internet,\" he said. Wolpert cites the Arab Spring, and the role the Internet played in that uprising, as how a permissioned, yet permissive, structure functions. Websites, albeit technology permissioned by ICANN, remained online during the protests and played a major role. What's the risk in experimenting with blockchain? \"The risk is we go crazy, we have an unruly mess,\" Wolpert warned. \"[But] it's the Linux Foundation, we've been in this movie before. While there's a lot of really smart guys working on Bitcoin and startups, we've got equally amount of people who also have 20 or 30 years of experience with open source and open innovation, and I think we have a good shot at maintaining restraints, keeping it scoped down, keeping it simple, but getting it to something that is useful.\"  \\\n",

              "text          One of the largest and oldest organizations for computing professionals will kick off its annual conference on the future of mobile cloud computing tomorrow, where blockchain is scheduled to be one of the attractions. With more than 421,000 members in 260 countries, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) holding such a high-profile event has the potential to accelerate the rate of blockchain adoption by the engineering community. At the four-day conference, beginning Tuesday, the IEEE will host five blockchain seminars at the 702-year-old Exeter College of Oxford. The conference, IEEE Mobile Cloud 2016, is the organization's fourth annual event dedicated to mobile cloud computing services and engineering. Speaking at the event, hosted at Oxford University, professor Wei-Tek Tsai of the School of Computing, Informatics and Decision Systems engineering at Arizona State University will talk about the future of blockchain technology as an academic topic of research. Computing shift While this looks to be the first IEEE conference to deal so closely with blockchain, its presence at an event dedicated to cloud computing is no surprise. 2016 is shaping up to be the year many stopped talking about bitcoin as a decentralized ledger and started talking about it as a database. Last month, IBM made a huge splash in the blockchain ecosystem when it announced among a wide range of other news, that it would be offering a wide range of blockchain-related initiatives.

Banks need to innovate at an accelerated pace, yet are unable to do so on their own. Allowing third-party developers to work together with the bank through API access would be a significant step in the right direction, as there is valuable input to be gathered from the Bitcoin and Fintech industries. Banks and other established financial players have not taken a liking to Fintech and digital currency just yet, as they see both industries as major competitors to their offerings. While it is certainly true Bitcoin and Fintech can bring significant improvements to the table, they should be seen as complementary allies who will bring success to the banking industry. Or that is what the Monetary Authority of Singapore seems to be thinking, at least. Also read: Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis For 03/28/2016 - Looking To Buy BTC? Embracing Bitcoin And Fintech As A Bank Is Necessary There is no denying the banking sector has seen very little to no real innovation for quite some time now, opening the door for other players to step in and offer something entirely different. In fact, a lot of financial experts see and as two major threats to the banking system, which would explain the vocal opposition to any solution that is not controlled by a bank or government. But the Monetary Authority of Singapore sees things different, as they feel both Fintech and Bitcoin are capable of complementing the current financial infrastructure, rather than be competing with banks. A combination of traditional banking with innovative technology and services has the potential to create a powerful and versatile financial ecosystem all over the globe. Fintech startups and entrepreneurs are renowned for thinking outside of the proverbial box when it comes to accessing financial services. Particularly where the money lending and peer-to-peer aspect is concerned, most Fintech companies have a leg up over their more traditional counterparts. But that does not mean these startups are looking to overthrow the banking system, although they might be able to in the long run. Any bank that is too slow - or simply unwilling - to innovate will be left behind in the long term, though. Collaborating with Fintech players is a far more preferable solution to this alternative, although it may involve swallowing some of the pride that are associated with the banking system. Fintech companies are, by design, more capable of embracing new and advanced technological features, which makes them invaluable allies for traditional banks. A Senior Regulator of the Monetary Authority of Singapore stated: \"MAS' approach to fintech is to use the power of technology to help banks to succeed. It's not a game of disruptors versus enablers. We see fintech as an enabler... The good news is fintech companies by design are creating far superior technology products, and where success lies is in partnering with banks, and enabling banks to succeed.\" But Bitcoin has a role to play in the financial world as well, although this system is completely outside of the control of banks and governments. Despite those barriers, the popular digital currency is available in every country in the world, allowing for frictionless and real-time transfers of value, regardless of previous access to financial services by consumers and businesses. So far, most of the major banks around the world have taking a page out of the Bitcoin playbook, by trying to develop their own blockchain technology solutions. But that is not all, as several countries are considering to issue their own digital currency, rather than embracing Bitcoin. Whether or not that will be the right decision, in the end, remains to be seen. It will take time until banks come around to the idea of embracing Bitcoin or Fintech, though. Banks need to innovate at an accelerated pace, yet are unable to do so on their own.

              "text          When most people think about computers and robots taking jobs away from humans, the images that usually come to mind are robots moving inventory around in an Amazon warehouse or McDonald's customers placing their order via a tablet instead of a cashier . But the robots are coming for much more sophisticated jobs as well. For example, blockchain technology is out to eat the lunches of some professionals in the traditional financial system. There's a Lot of Mistrust in the Banking System At a recent blockchain-focused event in Toronto, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd was asked to explain the reasoning behind Wall Street's increased interest in blockchain technology. During his initial response, Todd pointed out some of the mistrust that exists in the current financial system: \"The dirty secret is [the banks] don't actually trust [their databases]. I mean, they don't trust their own employees. ... They don't trust each other. There's so many levels of mistrust here.\" Todd then discussed the massive industry built around financial audits. He noted: \"If they did trust all this stuff, why are there so many auditors? Why is there this massive infrastructure of labor-intensive human beings sitting there poring over transactions and trying to figure out where the money got created out of thin air. Where did the money disappear? Who moved what where? Was it all legit?\" Many financial institutions are interested in the concept of creating new systems for record-keeping, which would replace the current closed-ledger system with a more open alternative, similar to Bitcoin. Many believe this open system would enable more efficient and transparent auditing of financial activity. The Status Quo Is Doing All Right But It's Hard to Improve Todd also pointed out that financial institutions are already pretty good at what they do in terms of audits. He stated, \"For the most part, bank fraud is at tolerable levels, it seems.\" Todd noted that maintaining a proper history of financial activity is one of the issues with increasing the speed of settlement . Because audits are labor intensive and require man hours to complete, it's difficult to essentially come to consensus on the correct version of events in a nearly instantaneous manner. He added, \"The faster money can move around, the faster you could lose it all due to some hacker.\" How Does the Blockchain Help? Todd spoke on the perceived advantages of blockchains over the current way things work, which relies on placing trust in database admins and the people with the keys to the system. From this perspective, a blockchain simply looks like a strong audit log. Todd gave a specific example of how this technology can help: \"It could be something as simple as when I, as a bank employee, type something in, we really do want a cryptographic signature that's actually tied to my keycard or something. And that should go into a database. Well, what does that look like? It looks like a blockchain.\" The longtime Bitcoin researcher also pointed out that this is sort of what banks were already looking at doing before blockchain technology started to receive a lot of attention. He explained: \"I think where they're thinking of going naturally looks like blockchains, so when they hear all this blockchain stuff it's like, 'Oh yeah. This is roughly what we were looking at doing anyway.'\" Replacing Humans Is the Point At one point during the recent event in Toronto, Todd was asked if the trend is that blockchains will eventually replace human auditors. Todd responded: \"All this blockchain stuff is really about: How good can we make the security to get to the point where we can imagine getting rid of human beings?\" Indeed, Todd's comments appear to fit well with Satoshi Nakamoto 's original Bitcoin white paper . In the paper, Nakamoto stated: \"What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust....\" Going back further, cypherpunk Nick Szabo has written about the concept that third parties are security holes. In addition to improving security by cutting out trusted parties, financial institutions can cut costs by replacing human labor with computer code.

              "text          Bitcoin.com spoke with the OpenLedger CEO, Ronny Boesing to get deeper insight of how decentralized conglomerates will challenge the status quo, why they will bring greater financial freedom to the public, and the disadvantages of Bitcoin when it comes to enterprise scaling compared to DC's. Also read: Deloitte: Blockchain Will 'Gain Significant Traction' by 2020 The Coming Age of 'Decentralized Conglomerates' As the OpenLedger team recently its Global Enterprise 3.0 program, its universal shared application called \"Decentralized Conglomerate\" (DC) is poised to revolutionize how we look at big business in the 21st century. For a long time, the traditional conglomerate model went unchallenged (e.g. Berkshire Hathaway, Philip Morris etc.) until the emergence of the Internet and increasing global interconnectivity. A new digital conglomerate structure began to emerge with the likes of Google (and its Alphabet Inc. parent company), which became more efficient at managing the production and distribution of their products. Nevertheless, the formal top-down structure of these new digital age conglomerates remained, including the the traditional way of how profits are distributed - that is, until now. \"Decentralized Conglomerates are the next logical step.\" - Ronny Boesing Bitcoin.com (BC): Conglomerates first existed in physical form such as Berkshire Hathaway, after which we saw the advent of digital ones such as Google and Alphabet. Are decentralized autonomous conglomerates the next logical step in this evolution? Ronny Boesing (RB): Without question, Decentralized Conglomerates are the next logical step. It should be noted that there will be Autonomous and Semi-Autonomous organizations that emerge. The difference being the level of organizational influence exerted over the universal platform. In an Autonomous Conglomerate, the contracts and workers would be completely independent of having any external influence or association with another entity, but may simply be using the same platform as another organization. In a Semi-Autonomous Conglomerate, there will be some level of external influence, support, or association with an official business. This means that an organization has special interest in the associated operations of the Conglomerate, and some semblance of top-down influence may occur. BC: What are the basic advantages of decentralized conglomerate over a centralized one like Google, for example? RB: A Decentralized Conglomerate allows organizations to join the forces of their communities on a universal platform that allows cross promotion and profit sharing, but does not force it. This paradigm also allows individual brand identities to flourish within the Conglomerate without having to worry about the interests of the Universal Platform conflicting with the interests of any given brand using the platform. In a traditional or even a digital conglomerate, the mission of the parent company guides the decisions of the subsidiaries. BC: Is anyone free to join such an online conglomerate community? RB: The system is agnostic, so that anyone who wants to create an asset for their organization or commodity has the capacity to do so. All tokens do not have equal risk, and some are far less risky than others to purchase. BC: Some could argue that MLM pyramid structured companies are also \"profit sharing\" communities, though this entails a lot of risk as we all know. What kind of risk is there for people choosing to enter and buy the digital tokens of a decentralized conglomerate or its constituents? RB: The risk of purchasing such tokens depends on many things, such as the market capitalization of the DC, the number of organizations connected to the DC, the capacity to exchange tokens for other forms of currency or products, the size of the reserve backing a given token. All tokens do not have equal risk, and some are far less risky than others to purchase. Everyone should do their due diligence to know how solid the infrastructure is behind any given token or DC. BC: Can't Bitcoin be considered the world's first decentralized conglomerate? RB: Bitcoin is not a conglomerate. It is a decentralized ledger. The only purpose of Bitcoin's blockchain was to keep track of transactions. Many organizations expanded upon the original protocol to create colored coins and languages that permitted applications to be built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. However, this was not the original intention of \"Bitcoin\" proper, and specifically talking about \"Bitcoin,\" it is apolitical, without special interest, and has no official organizational associations. [A decentralized conglomerate] was not the original intention of 'Bitcoin' proper, [...] it is apolitical, without special interest, and has no official organizational associations. Bitcoin is the world's first globally accepted currency that has no organizational associations, and that is simultaneously the best and worst aspect about it. Since there is no organization association, the problems that Bitcoin encounters rely on the community to come together and make a unilateral decision. As we have seen with the blocksize scaling issue , the transaction time debate , the recent DDoS attack, and the blockchain halt due to transaction costs; Bitcoin has some real problems that need to be addressed in order for it to be usable for enterprise scale organizations or countries alike. In that regard, since Bitcoin is apolitical, it doesn't really make logical sense for any country to switch to something which they have no control over as their main currency. So in that regard, Bitcoin is not only not a conglomerate, the apolitical aspect serves to keep organizations away from holding the currency during the fluctuations, as there is no real organization that has vested interest in keeping Bitcoin stable. BC: What exactly is OpenLedger's \"Bitcoin 3.0\" technology and what are Bitcoin's disadvantages compared to it when using it within the DC context? RB: As mentioned, Bitcoin has no associations. This means that the token can be purchased and amassed by any organization or country around the globe, leaving the token subject to wild swings due to margin trading. You see examples with organizations like Ether , Factom , or OpenLedger that have created a token that has organizational backing, and their respective tokens steadily increased in value instead of having wild unpredictable swings. Having an organization that has special interest in the Universal Ledger establishes a community and ecosystem which Bitcoin is lacking. It is the same type of culture that Apple has created using \"I\" branding that can be achieved with organizational associations. Bitcoin does not have this capacity. Having an organization that has special interest in the Universal Ledger establishes a community and ecosystem which Bitcoin is lacking. In order to get mass adoption or successful utilization, it is crucial to have a unified approach to the interface, and this becomes another major failing point of Bitcoin. Openledger has streamlined the UX/UI of digital currency transactions, and this represents a much more user-friendly approach with a smaller learning curve. Having development teams that can do research and development and then modify the UX based on user feedback is a great benefit that DC's have over Bitcoin. BC: Can you talk a little bit about the first partnerships between communities on this platform, namely OBITS and BitTeaser? RB: Every month, 70% of BitTeaser's monthly Bitcoin profits will be used to buyback BTSR and OBITS on the respective markets on OpenLedger. OBITS does it on the BTC (10%) and BTS (90%) market, and with BTSR it is done on BTS, BTC, USD and ETH markets 25% each. BTSR holders will receive 80% of this share, while OBITS holders will receive 20%. In the long term, BTSR holders may see an increase in the value per unit of their investment based on supply and demand, as well as having the tokens burned from every buyback thus reducing overall available supply. BitTeaser operates in a similar way to Google Adwords - revenue is generated based on providing advertising space for websites, companies and products. It currently serves over 1,000 webmasters, with monthly growth of around 15 to 20%. BC: Do they use smart-contracts to establish the terms? How is consensus achieved? RB: Yes, the system uses smart contracts to establish terms of service and reward. The consensus is achieved by third party confirmation that both sides have accomplished their respective tasks, whether it is putting money in escrow, or completing a contract request. BC: What was the approximate payout to the writers and bloggers using the platform? Will this amount increase as the overall platform grows? RB: At the last payment, some 11 BTC worth (currently around $4,500 USD) of BTSR and OBITS was sent to participating bloggers. That amount will increase as the network size and reach of the DC increases. OpenLedger has made it available for users to directly change tokens to USD, EUR, and CNY and have them directly deposited into their bank account. BC: How does the DC model interact with traditional fiat currency? Do users have to use an exchange to cash out their rewards? RB: \"In the same way that foreign currencies or bitcoin need to be exchanged before being used, any DC token will need to be changed to be used outside of the infrastructure. If an organization within the DC offers products or services that are desired, a direct purchase using a token could then be made without any exchange. Now, OpenLedger has made it available for users to directly change tokens to USD, EUR, and CNY and have them directly deposited into their bank account. No longer will a user have to have the hassle of going through an additional step of going to a bitcoin exchange to convert their smart money into fiat. Once a user has been validated he/she is prompted to attempt a withdrawal. Once the withdrawal request is made on OpenLedger for whatever currency is asked, the money is then sent to the user's bank account with a 3% withdrawal fee. Users can enjoy a fee-free deposit period that ends in August. [Note: Special thanks to Larry C. Bates, out of Bloomington, Indiana, the architect behind the great description of the DC, a good partner of OpenLedger and his assistance in giving answer to the questions.] Do you think decentralized conglomerates will change big business around the globe?

              "text          Ethereum, considered by many to be the most promising altcoin, has grabbed the attention of The New York Times. The \"newspaper of record\" has run a big feature story on Ethereum, noting its value has spiraled 1,000% in the last three months and is attracting interest from major financial companies that are using it for private blockchains and smart contracts. The story notes the first public version of Ethereum was recently released. The story noted there are numerous applications built on Ethereum that allow new ways to place bets, pay bills and even launch Ponzi schemes. Some cryptocurrency observers claim Ethereum will face more security issues than bitcoin due to its more complex software. The alt. currency system has faced less testing and suffered fewer attacks than bitcoin. The unusual design could also invite more regulatory scrutiny considering some potentially fraudulent contracts can be written into the system. Capabilities Draw Interest However, the system's capabilities have drawn interest from major corporations. Last year, IBM announced it was testing the alt.currency system as a way to manage real-world objects in the Internet of Things. Microsoft has been working on various projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its Azure computing cloud. Marley Gray, a business development and strategy director at Microsoft, said Ethereum is a platform for solving problems in different industries. He called it the most \"elegant\" solution seen to date. Private Blockchains Expand Many companies have created private blockchains using Ethereum. These private blockchains could eventually undermine the value of the Ether, the individual unit in the alt.currency system that people have been buying. Major banks have shown interest in using blockchains to make transferring and trading money more efficient. Several banks have examined how to use Ethereum. JPMorgan has developed a tool called Masala that enables its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum-blockchain. Michael Novogratz, who helped lead Fortress Investing Group invest in bitcoin, has been examining Ethereum since leaving Fortress last fall. He said he has made a significant purchase of Ether. Novogratz said in the last few months that the alt.currency is getting more validation. Ethereum Value Soars Ether's value has increased to as high as $12 from $1 since the beginning of the year, taking the value of all Ether currency to above $1 billion at times. This surpasses the value of any virtual currency besides bitcoin, which claimed more than $6 billion in value last week. Ethereum leads all altcoins in the size of its following One difference between Ethereum and bitcoin is that the latter came into being in a more transparent fashion. Where bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity remains a mystery, Ethereum was developed by Vitalik Buterin , a 21-year-old Russian, who created it after dropping out of Waterloo University in Ontario. Aim Was Smart Contracts Ethereum's basic aim was to make it possible to program agreements into the blockchain. This is the smart contract concept. Two people could, for instance, program a sport bet directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once a mutually-accepted source announced the final score (such as the Associated Press), the winnings would transfer automatically to the winner. Ether can be used as currency. Ether is also necessary to pay for the network power required to process the bet. Ethereum has been characterized as a single-shared computer operated by the network of users on which resources are doled out and paid for by Ether. Buterin's team raised $18 million through an Ether presale in 2014 to help fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the development of the software. Also read: Ether co-founder Vitalik Buterin on public and private blockchains Ethereum's Following Ethereum has attracted followers who have supported the software and hope that Ether will rise in value. There were 5,800 nodes, or computers, last week supporting the network. The bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. Joseph Lubin, a co-founder, established ConsenSys, which has hired more than 50 developers to create applications on the alt.currency system. One enables music distribution while another permits a new type of financial auditing. Lubin said he became interested in Ethereum after determining it delivered on some of bitcoin's failed promise, particularly when it came to permitting new types of online markets and contracts. He said Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver on the broad strokes vision that bitcoin presented. Joseph Bonneau, a Stanford computer science researcher, said Ethereum is the first system that caught his interest since bitcoin. Ethereum is nonetheless far from a certainty, Bonneau said. He said bitcoin is still most likely the safest bet, with Ethereum number two. He said Ethereum's longevity will depend on real markets developing around it. Featured image from Shutterstock.  \\\n",

              "text          Every marketing channel suffers from fatigue at one stage. Whether this is due to an increase of competition, rising costs of competing or hitting a ceiling of volume, every business will face the challenge of seeing diminishing returns on a once high-performing channel for them. I've come across this challenge many times, which has made me very focused on adopting new channels that have potential at an early stage to reap the rewards. Just take video ads within Facebook as an example. We're currently at a point where video ads are reaching their peak; cost is still relatively low and engagement is high, but, like with most ad platforms, increased competition will drive up those prices and make it less and less viable for smaller companies (and larger ones) to invest in it. Being an early adopter of a new channel can provide enormous benefits, but that comes with equally high risks. This is amplified within marketplaces like Amazon. Early adopters within Amazon's marketplace were able to focus on building a solid base of reviews for their products - a primary ranking signal - which meant that they'd create huge barriers to entry for competitors (namely because they were always showing up in the search results before them). Every marketing channel suffers from fatigue at one stage. Whilst the payout wasn't huge within the early days of Amazon, those who got in early are now seeing huge rewards, with 38% of shoppers starting their buying journey within Amazon ( source ), making it the number one retail search engine. Some studies are suggesting that Amazon is responsible for 80% of e-commerce growth for publicly traded web retailers ( source ). On the other hand, early adoption can be somewhat of a curse. In 2011, many companies and individuals, myself included, invested a lot of time and money into Google+, dubbed to be bigger than Facebook at the time. They acquired over 10 million new users within the first two weeks of launch and things were looking positive. Many companies doubled-down on growing a community within the platform, hopeful of using it as a new and growing acquisition channel, but things didn't exactly pan out that way . Google all but killed the social network in mid-2015 leaving a lot of early adopters licking their wounds. Life Beyond Email For as long as I can remember, email has been a fundamentally important channel for a large majority of businesses. The ability to market products directly through a channel that scales up to an incredibly high ceiling is very attractive. The only problem is that it's costing more and more money to acquire email addresses from potential customers, and the engagement from email is getting worse and worse. As the above chart ( source ) illustrates, email click-rate has been steadily declining. Whilst open rates seem to be increasing - largely driven by mobile - the actual engagement from email is nosediving. Not only that, but it's becoming more and more difficult to even reach someone's email inbox; Google's move to separate out promotional emails into their 'promotions' tab and increasing problems of email deliverability have been top reasons behind this. All that said, email is still an incredibly important channel for a lot of businesses and it undoubtedly still gets results. I don't think many people will argue that, whilst this is the case now, things are only going to get worse. As with many 'organic' channels, the relative reach of your audience tends to decline over time due to a variety of factors. In email's case, it can be the over-exposure to marketing emails and moves from email providers to filter out promotional content; with other channels it can be the platform itself. Back in 2014 I wrote about how \" Facebook's Likes Don't Matter Anymore \" in relation to the declining organic reach of Facebook pages. Last year alone the organic reach of publishers on Facebook fell by a further 52% . Subscribe via Messenger The Birth of Chatbots It's fair to say that I'm pretty obsessed with chatbots right now. There are some great applications popping up from brands that genuinely add value to the end consumer, and early signs are showing that consumers are actually responding really well to them. For those of you who aren't quite sure what I'm talking about, here's a quick overview of what a chatbot is: A chatbot is a service powered by rules, and sometimes artificial intelligence, that you interact with via a chat interface. The service could be any number of things, ranging from functional to fun, and it could live in any major chat product (Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Text Messages, etc.). ( source ) Awareness around chatbots is starting to grow, especially after Facebook came out mid-last year with their new Messenger platform that supported chatbots. On top of that, and like with a lot of things online, the adult industry has stimulated a lot of demand around chatbots. Just take a look at some of the most searched-for keywords in the search engines related to chatbots (data from Storybase ): This is why we can't have nice things. That aside, there are some really great chatbots that have been built that add a bunch of value whilst also benefitting the brand commercially. One that I really like is the Politico chatbot that gives you regular digests of news whilst also serving you up relevant information that you ask for. This is great for the consumer because they don't need to leave the environment of Facebook to get access to the content they want, and it's hugely beneficial to Politico, as they're able to push on-demand content through to an increasingly engaged audience - oh, and they can also learn a bunch of interesting things about their audience in the process (I'll get to this shortly). There are a bunch of e-commerce stores taking advantage of chatbots as well. One example that I was playing with was from Fynd that enables you to ask for specific products and they'll display them to you directly within Messenger. What's more, Facebook even allows you to make payments via Messenger bots , opening up a whole world of possibility to e-commerce stores. Bot experiences with more engaged audiences are getting 80-90% response rates. I spoke with Dmitriy Kachin from Chatfuel, a chatbot creation platform, to see how some of their customers' chatbots were performing in terms of read/response rates. Here's what he had to say: \" Obviously, numbers vary across the board - and better bot experiences with more engaged audiences are getting 80-90% response rates. While even the least favorable experiences are in the 35-40% range. \" Why Should You Care? Ok, so you're probably thinking, \"This all sounds great, Matt, but how can I do something with chatbots?\" Well, I've got you covered. Don't for a minute think that chatbots are some gimmick that is going to be available only to bring brands with huge audiences. Whilst there are a number of new chatbots appearing each week, the space is still in its infancy. This is the time to become an early adopter. Why? Here are five reasons to start with (and this is just with Messenger): As soon as someone engages with your chatbot, you have the ability to push messages to them within Facebook Messenger with very few limitations. You can use input from users to dynamically segment them into groups and serve different content to them. You can set up automation workflows in the same way that you would via email marketing automation. Click-through rates and general engagement is very high at this stage. You're more likely to get engagement within Messenger than from within your Facebook page because the communication is 1:1 and you're not competing with others in the newsfeed. Facebook has opened up the ability to run ads directly to Messenger . This means that anyone that engages with your ad can now be followed up with directly within Messenger (this is incredibly exciting). The fact that you can now run ads directly to Messenger is an enormous opportunity for any business. This skips the convoluted and leaky process of trying to acquire someone's email address to nurture them outside of Facebook's platform. Instead, you can retain the connection with someone inside Facebook and improve the overall conversion rates to receiving an engagement. Don't forget that you can also tap into platforms outside of Messenger as well, for example, Slack, Telegram and even SMS. If you're interested in bringing a chatbot to a whole bunch of these different platforms then I'd recommend checking out Flow XO . Subscribe via Messenger How Do I Create a Chatbot? One of the biggest hurdles to overcome with being an early adopter of a platform is that it often costs a lot of money and requires highly specialized skills. That's not the case with chatbots. You can actually go from an idea to a fully functioning chatbot within a matter of minutes, and it won't cost you anything. How is this possible? Chatfuel . Chatfuel is a platform that lets you build your own Chatbot for Messenger (and Telegram) for free. The only limit is if you pass more than 100,000 conversations per month, but for most businesses that won't be an issue. No understanding of code is required and it has a simple drag-and-drop interface. Think Wix/Squarespace for bots ( side note : I have zero affiliation with Chatfuel). There are other platforms similar to Chatfuel at the moment, but not many. Botsify is one, but I haven't actually used them yet. The first thing to do when mapping out your own chatbot is to figure out what unique value it could add to the user. One example of a chatbot that I'm testing out at the minute is a recipe recommendation bot that lives directly within Messenger. The basic way that it works will be that the user will say what ingredient (or list of a few ingredients) that they want to cook with and the chatbot will serve up relevant recipe recommendations. It's a simple idea but adds a ton of ongoing value to the user, and, more importantly, gives them a reason to regularly engage with the bot. This creates a bunch of opportunities to take the user down extra conversion paths - for example, purchasing ingredients, product recommendations and ongoing content subscriptions (to name a few). When you're thinking about designing your chatbot you should have a very clear answer to \"Why would someone continue to get value from this?\" Chatfuel Basics: Blocks and Rules The basic way that Chatfuel works is by linking \"blocks\" to \"AI Rules\". The best way to explain this is in the same context of email automation. Think of the \"blocks\" as individual emails, and the \"AI Rules\" as your automation rules (i.e., if a user does x , send them y ). Each interaction that you plan to make with the user should be built out in an individual block. Based on the user's input, they will receive different blocks afterwards. Here's a simple schematic of how a user would interact with individual \"blocks\" within my recipe recommendation example: This is an extremely simplified version of the interaction flow, but it should hopefully illustrate the basic premise behind \"blocks\". The rules can be set up so that if a user responds in a certain way, they'll be served a specific block. For example, in the flow I've outlined above, if a user says, \"No\" when asked if they want to see another recipe for the ingredient they specified, they'll be directed back to the \"Select Ingredient\" block. You can also create some rules based on keywords. For example, if a user types the words \"manage subscription\", you could send them to a block that asks them if they'd like to reduce the amount of messages they receive. This is one of many examples. In my recipe recommendation example, if a user types \"salmon recipes\" they'll be served up a selection of recipes that include salmon. This can be pulled in dynamically via the RSS plugin within Chatfuel. The plugin aspect to Chatfuel is one of the real bonuses. You can link up to all sorts of different services to add richer content to the conversations that you're having. This includes linking up to Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, as well as being able to request that the user share their location, serve video and audio content, and build out custom attributes that can be used to segment users based on their inputs. This last part is a killer feature. My advice here is to go in and create a free account with Chatfuel and just start playing around. They have a really useful \"Test This Chatbot\" feature that pings you a message in Messenger to start engaging with your bot in development mode so that you can test it out and improve it before going live. Using Chatbots to Grow Your Funnel Once you've started to get some engagement with your chatbot, you can start experimenting with a bunch of different ways to use it as an acquisition channel. Here are a few ideas that can get you started with understanding how to apply chatbots in a way that can grow your funnel. Some of these will apply directly to your business, whilst others will be less relevant. I'll be sharing more new ideas over time. Newsletter Opt-In Discount Code Content Upgrades Lining Up Meetings During my conversation with Dmitriy Kachin from Chatfuel, I asked him for some tips on getting the best possible results from broadcast messages. From analyzing Chatfuel's customer data, Dmitriy came back with the following: The overall quality of the content and its relevance to the audience the bot owner is reaching out to. Giving people a clear and precise expectation of what you will be sending, how often, and offering them the opportunity to choose whether they want to receive this type of content and how frequently. Give the users as much control as possible. Being mindful not to abuse the power of broadcasting (no more than 2 broadcast messages per day typically); otherwise, people start getting annoyed with the volume of messages and tend to unsubscribe, or mute the bot. Personalizing the content as much as possible - making use of FB's default user attributes (addressing users by name), using the segmentation features of the platform to learn as much as possible about the audience and offering specific groups of people only the type of content that is relevant to their needs, interests and choices. Final Thoughts If you're a subscriber to my email list or a regular follower of my blog then you'll likely hear me talking a lot about chatbots over the coming months. I've personally been testing them out a lot and plan to do a whole lot more - some of you will have received used my chatbot as part of my 'free SEO consultation' campaign. Ultimately, only time will tell how effective the likes of Facebook Messenger will become in the long term. As more and more companies look to use chatbots within the platform, the greater the frequency of messages that individual users will receive. This could result in Facebook (and other messaging platforms) placing stricter restrictions on usage, but until then I'd recommend testing as much as possible. If you're running a chatbot that's seen some success, I'd love to hear from you in the comments below. Subscribe via Messenger  \\\n",

With the new project Upspin, we aim to improve the situation by providing a global name space to name all your files. Given an Upspin name, a file can be shared securely, copied efficiently without \"download\" and \"upload\", and accessed by anyone with permission from anywhere with a network connection. Our target audience is personal users, families, or groups of friends. Although Upspin might have application in enterprise environments, we think that focusing on the consumer case enables easy-to-understand and easy-to-use sharing. File names begin with the user's email address followed by a slash-separated Unix-like path name: ann@example.com/dir/file. Any user with appropriate permission can access the contents of this file by using Upspin services to evaluate the full path name, typically via a FUSE filesystem so that unmodified applications just work. Upspin names usually identify regular static files and directories, but may point to dynamic content generated by devices such as sensors or services. If the user wishes to share a directory (the unit at which sharing privileges are granted), she adds a file called Access to that directory. In that file she describes the rights she wishes to grant and the users she wishes to grant them to. For instance, read: joe@here.com, mae@there.com allows Joe and Mae to read any of the files in the directory holding the Access file, and also in its subdirectories. As well as limiting who can fetch bytes from the server, this access is enforced end-to-end cryptographically, so cleartext only resides on Upspin clients, and use of cloud storage does not extend the trust boundary. Upspin looks a bit like a global file system, but its real contribution is a set of interfaces, protocols, and components from which an information management system can be built, with properties such as security and access control suited to a modern, networked world. Upspin is not an \"app\" or a web service, but rather a suite of software components, intended to run in the network and on devices connected to it, that together provide a secure, modern information storage and sharing network. Upspin is a layer of infrastructure that other software and services can build on to facilitate secure access and sharing. This is an open source contribution, not a Google product. We have not yet integrated with the Key Transparency server, though we expect to eventually, and for now use a similar technique of securely publishing all key updates. File storage is inherently an archival medium without forward secrecy; loss of the user's encryption keys implies loss of content, though we do provide for key rotation. It's early days, but we're encouraged by the progress and look forward to feedback and contributions. To learn more, see the GitHub repository at upspin .  \\\n",

              "text          Introduction I've talked previously about my initial experience with MacOS. While I still love the laptop and how well it works, my favourite applications in it have very little to do with Apple's ecosystem - Most of them are command-line application that are shared with most of the UNIX/Linux world. Adopting the terminal for most of my interactions allows me to be a lot more productive - I can work on multiple projects, tasks and easily switch contexts and folders. Below are some of my currently favourite CLI applications. zsh / oh-my-zsh zsh is an alternative to bash, it comes with multiple features that enhance the general usage of the terminal. These are the ones I find myself constantly using: More practical auto-complete - Visual and arrows-navigable auto-complete Auto-complete directories from a single letter - Complete directories like cd ~/d/y and take you directly to cd ~/Downloads/YouTube Go back to your directory history with cd - Auto complete in git- Jump between branches with a quick tab Besides the core functionality of zsh, there are plenty of plugins to choose from. history-substring-search allows you to start typing a command, and then press up to search for all the commands that start that way. If you find your colours to be too dull, install syntax-highlighting plugin. Now you can spot the syntax error before running the command: And just to make your terminal a bit prettier, there is the powerful prompt. Besides being pretty it allows you to see easily your current git status and branch. Here is what mine looks like: Copying output to clipboard (without a mouse) Part of the advantages of using the terminal, is that you don't need a mouse... Until you need to copy something. Here are some options for mouse-less copying. yank With yank all you need to copy something is redirect its output to it, like so: pbcopy (MacOS) / xclip (Linux) Both of these commands would copy the content that was piped to them: iTerm2 integration iTerm2 has plenty of features to make it my favorite terminal shell. Its integration feature allows you, among many other things , to easily select and copy the output of the last command: fasd One of my first pains when working in the command-line was: \"How do I get to my project folder? Surely writing cd ~/my/very/long/path will get old very quickly?\". Luckily fasd can help with that (and more). Once installed and configured, it listens silently as you cd to various folders. As soon as you do, however, it remembers its path and allows you to do it much faster next time. In the example below, I go to a directory manually. Then to go back to it, I just use fasd's z command and switch back. Beside changing directories, you can also use fasd's shortcuts for other operations using the comma (,) command, e.g: lnav I find lnav to be one of the best ways to cope with log files. The fact that it is also in CLI just makes it easier to work with. It effortlessly loads a single file or a whole folder with multiple log files, and allows you to filter, search and follow it very swiftly. Here I open a folder in lnav, with many log files, and filter to get the specific lines I want: peco peco is used to quickly filter the output of commands. Consider it to be the interactive version of grep . For example, let's search inside my command line history to remind me syntax of git merge-base : Note that peco returned the selected line - That means you can use it with other applications. For example, let's get the pid of Evernote to the clipboard with the aforementioned yank : tig I've started using git with a proper GUI client. As time progressed, however, I found the terminal to be faster and better for many of the common operations: checkout/pull/merge. However, some of the operations do require interactivity. When I view git's log I would like to move freely between commits and when committing, I'd like to be able to select the files I'd like to stage. Using a proper GUI client for that, however, is distracting - It breaks you out of the terminal and breaks the flow of the regular commands. tig helps you with that. git log To watch the history, just run tig in the directory - You will be able to view each commit, affected files and the relevant diff. git commit By running tig status it is easy to stage the files you'd like to commit, or even specific lines (chunks) git difftool Just because you're in text mode and specifically tig, doesn't mean you have to rely on text-mode diff. If you're a fan of a proper diff/merge tool (e.g. Beyond Compare) it is easy to configure tig to open one. Simply add the following to your .tigrc file: Now simply select a changed file and press F4 ranger Even if you're comfortable with the terminal, some actions can still be a chore. Quickly exploring multiple directories, copying multiple by selection to another folder, etc. As a short example, here is how I would copy some files with ranger : realpath What do you do if you need to provide a certain file in the terminal to an open GUI application? For example, if you want to get the path of a photo to your photo editing program? You could do pwd , to get the current directory, and then append to it the name of file. But there's an easier way. realpath gives you the real, absolute path of any file, like so: mackup So you got your applications configured. What will happen once your computer dies or gets replaced? mackup (for both MacOS and Linux) is a really simple way to backup your configurations to Dropbox, or another cloud storage. Its method is ingenious -instead of making copies and schedules, all it does is simply copies the file once to your Dropbox and replaces the original with the symlink. The applications continue working with their configurations as usual, but they are actually modifying them on your Dropbox. Now every configuration change you do is immediately back-upped by your cloud storage. It's worth to emphasize - Unlike other backup applications, you only run mackup once . Tell me about yours! Hub  - Avoid going to GitHub for pull requests and forks! Perform most of GitHub's operations from the comfort of the command line. Tmux  - A multiplexer for the terminal, really useful if you work on a remote computer and would like to work with multiple tabs, panes and disconnect without closing your environment and processes. Fzf  - Fuzzy finder, similiar to peco. While at it, you might also want to check fzy . There are quite a few others too, though, I am not sure what's the difference. Mdlt  - A calculator for the command line that can also integrate and derive. I would be happy to hear about your favorite command line applications and how you use them.

              "text          A Liga Ventures, aceleradora de startups especializada em gerar negócios entre startups e grandes corporações, oficializou, nesta quinta-feira (23), a criação da Liga IoT, uma plataforma de inovação aberta que vai prospectar, selecionar e acelerar startups ligadas à Internet das Coisas. A vertical temática contará com grandes parceiros corporativos e o primeiro a aderir ao programa é a Intel. O principal objetivo da plataforma é conectar grandes empresas com startups do setor para que explorem oportunidades de negócio ou testem novas tecnologias em conjunto. A Liga IoT cria um ecossistema que foca em compreender e antecipar a revolução que a Internet das Coisas está trazendo para diversos setores como agricultura, varejo, indústria, automação de casas e edifícios e cidades inteligentes. A Intel está engajada na iniciativa que irá abrir portas para que startups possam testar novas soluções e explorar oportunidades de negócios com seus clientes e parceiros. \"Acreditamos no trabalho de startups como uma maneira de acelerar a chegada da Internet das Coisas no Brasil. Como se trata de um mercado novo e de alto potencial, há um enorme espaço para tomar à frente da inovação e gerar produtos e serviços de alto valor agregado\", comenta Maurício Ruiz, diretor geral da Intel Brasil. \"A Intel desenvolve soluções de hardware e software para Internet das Coisas que são referência mundial. Através da Liga IoT, podemos utilizar esses recursos para apoiar os empreendedores que irão fazer a diferença no futuro.\" A iniciativa se soma a outros programas que a Liga Ventures possui com empresas como Porto Seguro, AES Brasil, EMBRAER e Mercedes-Benz. \"Para nós, é muito importante ter a Intel como grande parceira na Liga IoT. Estamos seguros de que juntos ofereceremos muitas oportunidades para os empreendedores que participarem do programa\" é o que diz Rogério Tamassia, Sócio-diretor da Liga Ventures. A plataforma Liga IoT Serão selecionadas 5 startups de hardware ou software com soluções em Internet das Coisas em temas como agricultura, varejo, indústria, veículos conectados, automação de casas e edifícios, cidades inteligentes e outros. As startups passarão por um programa de aceleração de quatro meses em São Paulo. Durante esse período, elas terão acesso a tecnologias e executivos da Intel, com quem podem explorar sinergias e oportunidades de negócio, além da rede de mentores da Liga Ventures e a amplo networking com potenciais parceiros e investidores. Os principais objetivos são desenvolver o ecossistema de IoT no Brasil e explorar novas oportunidades de negócios. Nenhuma contrapartida em participação societária ou propriedade intelectual é exigida das startups. As inscrições para o 1° ciclo de aceleração da Liga IoT já estão abertas e vão até o dia 2 de abril.

              "text          Amazon has launched Chime, a video conferencing and chat service that promises less shitty remote meetings and group calls. Aimed at business users and available for Windows , Mac, Android and iOS , Chime lets you hold video chats with up to 16 people on your desktop or 8 people on mobile devices; participants can also share their screens and files, record meetings (voice video and shared files are included) and even dial in to a meeting with a standard phone line. The company says that its new app is totally secure, thanks to 256-bit encryption that's used across Amazon Web Services products; it also boasts noise-cancelling wideband technology for clear audio. With that, Amazon is ready to take on rival conference services like Microsoft's Skype for Business and Citrix's GoToMeeting . Chime is competitively priced at $2.50 per user per month for the Plus plan, while the Pro plan that allows meetings with up to 100 people costs $15 per user each month. For comparison, GoToMeeting will set you back by $19 a month for 10 participants, and $49 per month for 100 users. Skype for Business is bundled with Microsoft's Office 365 online productivity suite and starts at $5 per user per month for a basic package of apps; the full bundle costs $12.50 per user per month. If you're having a hard time deciding on which tool to go with, be sure to check out Zapier's new roundup of video conferencing tools that pits Chime against 11 other options. You can give Chime a go right now by selecting the free tier that allows calls between just two people, or a 30-day trial of the Pro plan, no credit card required.

              "text          February 9, 2017 - We begin each year with a look at the K-12 computer science landscape - whether the direct impact of Code.org and our partners, or the indirect and sometimes unrelated impact of other global efforts that share our vision. It's been three and a half years since Code.org hired our first employee. We've been humbled to watch the world's education system embrace computer science, at an ever-accelerating pace. During this short time, 11 countries, 31 U.S. states, and over 120 U.S. cities and school districts have announced efforts to expand access to computer science as part of the K-12 curriculum; the new Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course has launched in over 2,000 classrooms; over 50,000 U.S. teachers have attended workshops to begin teaching computer science; over 500,000 teachers globally have begun teaching computer science classes to over 16 million students; diversity in computer science classrooms has improved for two years in a row; the Hour of Code has surpassed 350 million served - reaching one out of every 10 students on the planet; and 8 Presidents and Prime Ministers have hosted events to inspire millions more to join this teacher-powered movement. To be clear, this isn't the work of Code.org alone. We've had the support of hundreds of partners , and hundreds of thousands of educators, globally. Many of them began this work years before we existed. The international momentum is led by partners who share our mission in other countries. And in the U.S., this movement has had the bipartisan support of the federal government as well as most state governments. Our largest donors - Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Infosys, and Omidyar Network - deserve special recognition for funding not only Code.org but also the other nonprofits working towards the same goal, globally. We are thankful for all the efforts that share our mission. When we launched Code.org in 2013, it seemed impossible to change the entire education system. Although we still have a long way to go, 2016 was yet another record year, making us more confident than ever in our ability to realize our vision - that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science.

Policies changed in: 5 states 16 states 17 states, including $9M in CS funding 31 states , including $13M in CS funding Addressing diversity in K-12 computer science is core to our mission. We all know the technology sector as a whole has a diversity problem , caused by a variety of factors. Our focus is on one piece of the problem, the education pipeline, where historically only 20~25% of students are female, and 13~15% are underrepresented minorities. By contrast, the students across Code.org classrooms are far more balanced across gender, race, and also socioeconomic status. This is partly because teachers integrate our courses into classrooms that are already diverse, and partly because we incorporate a focus on diversity throughout our work . For example, we published a study of 8,000 students who took a survey right before and after trying our tutorials. Among female high school students, the number who agreed with the statement \"I like computer science\" jumped from 55% to 75% from just one session of using Code.org's Hour of Code activities. As another example, consider our Computer Science Principles course, designed for the new AP Computer Science exam. Traditionally, AP Computer Science is dominated by white and Asian males, with at most 15% underrepresented minorities. In our 512 classrooms, 49% of the students are underrepresented minorities - which adds up to more students than the entire nation's AP computer science exam participation in 2016. (Side note: 53% of Code.org's staff are women. Our board and leadership team are gender-balanced.) In the 3 years since we launched our Code Studio coding platform, 1/10 of all students on the planet have engaged in our computer science courses, making Code Studio the most broadly used curriculum in computer science. Of course, millions of these students are \"drive-by\" users. What matters more to us is how many teachers incorporate our lessons into their classrooms, and what their students learn. Example high school classroom project, using turtle-drawing commands Measuring by registered students, registered teachers, or monthly activity, Code Studio has doubled in scale in the last 12 months. But instead of measuring logins or page-views, in the last year, we embarked on creating a new metric of success. We began counting students who demonstrate \"basic coding proficiency\" in our CS Fundamentals course using a definition which we created based on student success at coding challenges. The chart below shows how many students demonstrated this proficiency at different levels of difficulty. (This is our first stab at measuring student proficiency, and we have a lot of work to improve it.) The secret behind our growth is simple: teachers recommend our courses to other teachers. One way to measure this is with the Net Promoter methodology : we score 85 among teachers, which is outstanding. This high score is supported by the testimonials we hear from teachers in classrooms. In the 2016-17 school year, we formally launched our App Lab app-making tool, and began scaling our new College Board endorsed Computer Science Principles course to prepare for a new AP exam. Computer science is already the fastest-growing AP course offered by the College Board, having almost doubled since Code.org launched. With this year's new exam, 2017 is poised to be its biggest year yet. There are 2,600 schools participating in the new exam, according to the College Board audit. Among schools using College Board endorsed curricula, 55% are using Code.org's CS Principles course. More than 75,000 students have interacted with our CS Principles course this school year. Our focus is the 512 classrooms of teachers in our professional learning program. These classrooms have 18,615 students enrolled, of which 5,721 are female students, and 9,083 are underrepresented minorities. If these students all take the exam, we have the opportunity to double the number of underrepresented minorities in AP computer science in just one year. In 2016 Code.org's professional learning and school outreach programs accelerated in every dimension. We hosted 4 large professional learning conferences for educators, with stellar feedback. And we grew our network of regional partners and expert facilitators - this network will provide the backbone for the future growth of K-12 computer science. 52,000 computer science teachers prepared by Code.org Our professional learning network: over 40 regional partners, 400 expert facilitators And above all, across all our programs, we passed a new milestone: 52,000 computer science teachers have been prepared by Code.org. Most of these are elementary school teachers who will begin teaching 10-20 hours of computer science per year. But thousands of them are high school teachers teaching a year-long computer science class. More importantly, the feedback from our professional learning workshops is uniformly fantastic. The vast majority of teachers attending these workshops rank them the \"best professional development\" they've ever experienced. This is partly because America's teachers want to learn and teach computer science, and partly because of the amazing passion of our expert facilitators. While most of Code.org's staff and resources are focused on implementing computer science programs in schools, we have a small, crack team working on changing government policies to support, expand, and sustain K-12 computer science. This effort wouldn't be possible without our coalition partners (especially Microsoft and the College Board), and our many local champions deserve the real credit for driving local change. Our state policy work focuses on 9 ideas we urge every state to consider . Below, we highlight our impact across 3 of these that are easiest to measure. Policy area Policy changed since 2013 High school graduation policy States that have changed policies to allow rigorous CS courses to satisfy core high school graduation requirements AL, AZ, AR, CA, CO, FL, ID, IL, KY, LA, MD, MN, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, TN, VA, WA, WV, WI Establishing state-level standards for CS States that have developed or are in the process of developing state education standards for computer science AR, CA, CO, FL, ID, IN, MA, NJ, SC, TX, VA, WA, WI, and WV. States that are evaluating developing standards: AL, DE, MD, MT, OK, and RI. Funding for CS States that have allocated funding specifically to K-12 computer science AR, AZ, GA, ID, MA, RI, UT, VA, WA. These states have allocated $13.01M in total Throughout 2016 we saw growing momentum for computer science among local governments beyond just the policy measures listed above. Chicago Public Schools became the first major school district to make computer science a graduation requirement for all students. The US Conference of Mayors proposed a resolution (sponsored by the mayors of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Baltimore) to expand computer science in schools. Last but not least, we launched the Governors for CS partnership, bringing together the governors of Arkansas, Washington, Rhode Island, Iowa, Virginia, Idaho, and Nevada to build plans for K-12 computer science with more governors to join in 2017. After over a year of work by fourteen states and four school districts, dozens of writers and advisors, and leaders in corporate, nonprofit, and education sectors, the K-12 Computer Science Framework was launched in October with broad support . The framework offers a set of guidelines that could be used to inform the development of standards, curriculum, and computer science pathways, and also help school systems build capacity for teaching computer science. The impact of all the experts and organizations who came together to create the Framework will be felt for years to come. In December, we hosted 22 state teams to plan implementation work, and we will continue similar convenings to build on the momentum. In addition, in 2016, ETS announced it will create a new Praxis exam for credentialing teachers in computer science, and Pearson is working on a similar exam - both informed by the Framework. 2016 was the biggest year ever for the Hour of Code , which has now surpassed 350 million \"served.\" This year, Code.org handed important reins of the campaign to the education community: We gave a committee and review board the responsibility of setting the guidelines and rating the recommended activities . Hundreds of global nonprofits, corporations, and government agencies supported the campaign. From the new tutorials launched by Disney, Microsoft, and Google, to the activities and promotions hosted at Facebook offices and Apple stores, to the thousands of industry volunteers from other companies, the collaboration was amazing. Our own web site hummed along more smoothly than ever, thanks to the support of Amazon Web Services. The global campaign was launched by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . And the world's greatest athletes supported this year's Hour of Code with a special inspirational video for students. Presidents and prime ministers rally around the Hour of Code Eight presidents and prime ministers around the world have now hosted symbolic events to inspire students and educators to try computer science. The global Hour of Code campaign has established Computer Science Education Week as a fixture in hundreds of thousands of schools, each year recruiting tens of millions of new students and hundreds of thousands of teachers to try computer science. The work of our global partners has also helped build global momentum for computer science. In 2016, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Ireland, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia followed the lead set by UK, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Australia, and Italy to announce plans to integrate computer science into national curriculum. (See status of global CS efforts ) Last but certainly not least, the biggest headline in computer science in 2016 was the Obama administration's announcement of Computer Science for All . The President announced that \"in the new economy, computer science isn't an optional skill, it's a basic skill.\" The announcement was coupled with a $4 billion proposal for Federal funding. Although the headline funding of CS for All didn't pan out, the bully pulpit played an important role to accelerate this movement. The White House helped amplify and celebrate the work of the computer science community, and President Obama's personal support for Code.org has been invaluable to the movement's international growth. Local efforts such as CS4RI , CS4NH , CS4TX have sprung up in response and will serve as new rallying cries for the movement. Meanwhile, Congress unanimously authorized long-term NSF funding for computer science research which has provided foundational guidance and support to many efforts in the space. NSF funding has established new CS courses in hundreds of classrooms: 5~10% of all new CS teachers prepared this decade were funded by the NSF, and ~19% of all AP CS Principles teachers are teaching NSF-funded curricula. We're thankful to the bipartisan leadership of the Representatives and Senators who supported continuing this work. Of course, together with the new CS Education Coalition , we will continue advocating for federal funding for computer science. Although most of the last few years' progress to expand computer science in U.S. schools have been funded by private donors and state governments, an injection of federal funding would greatly accelerate these efforts. Code.org recently penned a memo for the Trump administration laying out a very simple case: In 2016, Fortune 500 CEOs, 27 governors, and top education leaders joined forces to call for federal funding to address this. In 2017, thanks to the leadership of champions from both parties, we are as hopeful as ever that this goal is within reach. With yet another year of growth, we are more confident than ever in the strength and momentum behind the computer science movement, not just in the United States, but globally. Hundreds of thousands of worldwide educators have decided that every student in every school deserves the opportunity to learn computer science. The strength of this movement lies in the inspirational commitment of these teachers and educators. The nonprofits, philanthropists, and local governments who support them will continue and even accelerate our work in 2017 and beyond.

              "text          At JPMorgan Chase & Co., a learning machine is parsing financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours. The program, called COIN, for Contract Intelligence, does the mind-numbing job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went online in June, consumed 360,000 hours of lawyers' time annually. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg While the financial industry has long touted its technological innovations, a new era of automation is now in overdrive as cheap computing power converges with fears of losing customers to startups. Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for the biggest U.S. bank. The firm recently set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue, while reducing expenses and risks. The push to automate mundane tasks and create new tools for bankers and clients -- a growing part of the firm's $9.6 billion technology budget -- will be a theme as the company hosts its annual investor day on Tuesday. Behind the strategy, overseen by Chief Operating Operating Officer Matt Zames and Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy, is an undercurrent of anxiety: Though JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as one of few big winners, its dominance is at risk unless it aggressively pursues new technologies, according to interviews with a half-dozen bank executives. Redundant Software That was the message Zames had for Deasy when he joined the firm from BP Plc in late 2013. The New York-based bank's internal systems, an amalgam from decades of mergers, had too many redundant software programs that didn't work together seamlessly. \"Matt said, 'Remember one thing above all else: We absolutely need to be the leaders in technology across financial services,'\" Deasy said last week in an interview. \"Everything we've done from that day forward stems from that meeting.\" A QuickTake explainer on fintech After visiting companies including and three years ago to understand how their developers worked, the bank set out to create its own computing cloud called Gaia that went online last year. Machine learning and big-data efforts now reside on the private platform, which effectively has limitless capacity to support their thirst for processing power. The system already is helping the bank automate some coding activities and making its 20,000 developers more productive, saving money, Zames said. When needed, the firm can also tap into outside cloud services from , and . Tech Spending JPMorgan will make some of its cloud-backed technology available to institutional clients later this year, allowing firms like to access balances, research and trading tools. The move, which lets clients bypass salespeople and support staff for routine information, is similar to one announced in 2015. JPMorgan's total technology budget for this year amounts to 9 percent of its projected revenue -- double the industry average, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck. The dollar figure has inched higher as JPMorgan bolsters cyber defenses after a 2014 data breach, which exposed the information of 83 million customers. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg One-third of the budget is for new initiatives, a figure Zames wants to take to 40 percent in a few years. He expects savings from automation and retiring old technology will let him plow even more money into new innovations. Not all of those bets, which include several projects based on a distributed ledger, like blockchain, will pay off, which JPMorgan says is OK. One example executives are fond of mentioning: The firm built an electronic platform to help trade credit-default swaps that sits unused. 'Can't Wait' \"We're willing to invest to stay ahead of the curve, even if in the final analysis some of that money will go to product or a service that wasn't needed,\" Marianne Lake, the lender's finance chief, told a conference audience in June. That's \"because we can't wait to know what the outcome, the endgame, really looks like, because the environment is moving so fast.\" As for COIN, the program has helped JPMorgan cut down on loan-servicing mistakes, most of which stemmed from human error in interpreting 12,000 new wholesale contracts per year, according to its designers. JPMorgan is scouring for more ways to deploy the technology, which learns by ingesting data to identify patterns and relationships. The bank plans to use it for other types of complex legal filings like credit-default swaps and custody agreements. Someday, the firm may use it to help interpret regulations and analyze corporate communications. Another program called X-Connect, which went into use in January, examines e-mails to help employees find colleagues who have the closest relationships with potential prospects and can arrange introductions. Creating Bots For simpler tasks, the bank has created bots to perform functions like granting access to software systems and responding to IT requests, such as resetting an employee's password, Zames said. Bots are expected to handle 1.7 million access requests this year, doing the work of 140 people. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg While growing numbers of people in the industry worry such advancements might someday take their jobs, many Wall Street personnel are more focused on benefits. A survey of more than 3,200 financial professionals by recruiting firm Options Group last year found a majority expect new technology will improve their careers, for example by improving workplace performance. Click here for Options Group's survey on technology's impact \"Anything where you have back-office operations and humans kind of moving information from point A to point B that's not automated is ripe for that,\" Deasy said. \"People always talk about this stuff as displacement. I talk about it as freeing people to work on higher-value things, which is why it's such a terrific opportunity for the firm.\" To help spur internal disruption, the company keeps tabs on 2,000 technology ventures, using about 100 in pilot programs that will eventually join the firm's growing ecosystem of partners. For instance, the bank's machine-learning software was built with , a software firm that JPMorgan first encountered in 2009. \"We're starting to see the real fruits of our labor,\" Zames said. \"This is not pie-in-the-sky stuff.\"  \\\n",

The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system. But the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things. Microsoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure. \"Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution - the most elegant solution we have seen to date,\" said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft. Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft's work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced. Blockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any central authority or repository. Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained and updated by networks of computers working together - somewhat similar to the way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users. Many corporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system - known as an Ether - that people have recently been buying. The interest in Ethereum is one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks have expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer faster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will gather for a conference, \"Blockchain: Tapping I nto the Real Potential , Cutting Through the Hype.\" Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some version of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a specific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum blockchain. Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the private equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress's investment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress last fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a \"significant\" purchase of Ether in January. He has also heard how the financial industry's chatter about the virtual currency has evolved. \"A lot of the more established players were thinking, 'It's still an experiment,' \" he said. \"It feels like in the last two to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more validation.\" Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit of Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week. Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum. Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario. The most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain - the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source - say, The Associated Press - the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet. The Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether. A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin's team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software's development. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers - or nodes - helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. One of Mr. Buterin's co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up ConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to build applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music distribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing. The ConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy trademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and computer parts lying around. Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum after starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of Bitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and markets. \"Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver that vision,\" he said. Joseph Bonneau, a computer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-currencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his interest since Bitcoin. It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned. \"Bitcoin is still probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks will say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,\" Mr. Bonneau said. \"It will depend if any real markets develop around it.

              "      <th>The Aite Group projects the blockchain market could be valued at $400 million by 2019. For that reason, some of the biggest names in banking, industry and technology have entered into the space to evaluate how this technology could change the financial world. IBM and Linux, for instance, have brought together some of the brightest minds in the industry and technology to work on blockchain technology through the Hyperledger Project. The Hyperledger Project is under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, and seeks to incorporate findings by blockchain projects such as Blockstream, Ripple, Digital Asset Holdings and others in order to make blockchain technology useful for the world's biggest corporations. IBM has also contributed its own code to the project. According to John Wolpert, IBM's Global Blockchain Offering Director, when IBM and Linux began working together on the blockchain project, Linux made clear it wanted to \"disrupt the disruption,\" in part with their findings, as well as the data gathered by projects such as Ripple, Ethereum and others exploring the blockchain. The Linux foundation announced its Hyperledger project on December 17, 2015. Just one day later, 2,300 companies had requested to join. The second-largest open source foundation in the history of open source had only 450 inquiries. \"So, it's either going to be a holy mess or it's going to change the world,\" Wolpert said at The Blockchain Conference in San Francisco presented by Lighthouse Partners. As Wolford puts it, a team of IBMers is \"on a quest\" to understand and \"do something important\" with blockchain technology. \"I don't know why we got this rap in the '70s, way back, that we are not cool, that we're kind of stodgy, and that is not the IBM of my experience,\" Wolpert, who founded the taxi service Flywheel, explained. \"We're the original crazy people. The craziest people are the guys at IBM in the '60s and '70s -- you can imagine what they were doing in the '60s -- they are wild-eyed revolutionaries.\" Although this is not the image IBM markets, their work in quantum computing, quantum teleportation and neuro semantic chips count among some of the \"cool stuff\" IBM does, says Wolpert. IBM also approaches projects in the spirit of open innovation, and not proprietarily. \"Our method of operations is open, and it's often our MO to back not-our-thing,\" he said of IBM since the 1990s. Wolpert cites Java as one such project: \"You would not know about Java today if it weren't for IBM.\" As a \"pretty young dude,\" Wolpert was in the room when IBM made a billion-dollar decision to back Linux over its own technology. He also cites IBM's work on XML as an example of IBM's dedication to open innovation. Currently, IBM has employees working on crypto-security and distributed systems who have been working on consensus algorithms for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. \"They're crazy smart, we're planetary, we've gone from a couple of guys in a canoe, to a platoon and approaching an army of people working on blockchain,\" Wolpert said. \"So it feels a lot like my first job at IBM which was making Java real for business.\" This has led old and new friends to contact the the multinational technology and consulting corporation. \"Banks who have been calling us constantly ... saying 'What's your view on blockchain?' or 'Hey, let's do a project together on blockchain,'\" Wolpert said. \"We've been doing all these crazy projects on blockchain, every kind of blockchain, and learning a lot, been doing that for a couple years and really started to accelerate last year.\" Today, there is a whole unit dedicated to blockchain technology at Linux Foundation. \"We went all-in on blockchain,\" he explained. What's it all about for Wolpert? \"It's about evolving the Internet.\" Bitcoin is important for moving money around without a single authority. \"[Bitcoin] is a solution to a problem, a specific problem, of people who need to move money around in environments where you don't trust the government,\" Wolpert said. \"I think we can all agree we are approaching the end of the era where a single authority manages trust and gets compensated for the risk in doing so.\" In Wolpert's view, finance does not need to go from today's system of trust -- where consumers trust institutions to handle their money -- to one of complete trustlessness, like the Bitcoin system in which a protocol, not a centralized authority, manages the movement of value. \"It doesn't follow, having one single trust authority to trustlessness on everything,\" he said. \"There is a false dichotomy between the notion of trust and trustlessness, that you have to have a walled garden on one side and Bitcoin on the other.\" He doesn't compare Bitcoin to the Internet, saying that's a wrong analogy. \"It is not apt to say the Internet is like Bitcoin; the Internet is, from the perspective of Bitcoin, a permissioned walled garden,\" he said. \"Ever heard of ICANN? It's permissive, but it's permissioned.\" Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum are \"Iteration 1\" of blockchain technology, the three time IBMer told his audience. Wolpert thinks blockchain technology will soon evolve to \"Iteration 2.\" The problem with it? \"The Internet is constrained,\" Wolpert said. \"You have a fabric that allows for lots of competition on platforms and huge amounts of competition on solutions and applications on top of it, so we need to evolve the Internet to become economically aware, and that Internet isn't going to be an application, it is going to be a fabric and then lots of applications on top of that.\" This doesn't mean blockchain 2.0 technologies such as Blockstream, Ethereum and Ripple are lost causes that must now completely retool. The Linux Foundation, in fact, works with Ethereum and Ripple employees. With its blockchain projects, IBM is not focused on moving a cryptocurrency. \"Lots of banks pay us lots of money and we like that, and we want to radically improve them,\" Wolpert explained. \"[Bankers] are gonna try like heck to radically improve what is going on ahead of the disruption, disrupt themselves if you will. If you look at things like [Overstock's] t0, that's happening, might happen on Bitcoin protocol, but might not, and there's plenty of ways to solve it, when you commit to it. And sure, Bitcoin has woken [banks] up to this, so it's doing its job, it's disrupting the thinking and maybe that is all that is necessary.\" Wolpert wonders aloud during his speech if the world would have iTunes were it not for Napster, or Netflix if it weren't for BitTorrent. The former head of products for IBM's Watson Ecosystem says IBM currently has a \"boomtown with giant numbers of people at IBM and everywhere else\" investigating the blockchain problem and how distributed technology can be made useful for industry. He details how oftentimes IBM tinkers with open innovations itself to make the technology ready for industry. That's not the route being taken with Bitcoin. That the Bitcoin network is on par with Ireland for energy consumption, and that mining consortiums could eventually dictate that market, scares the firm away from dealing directly with Bitcoin. \"What I want to see, what we want to see, is a world full of companies who I can know, who I can identify, who are so spread out, like the Internet,\" he said. Wolpert cites the Arab Spring, and the role the Internet played in that uprising, as how a permissioned, yet permissive, structure functions. Websites, albeit technology permissioned by ICANN, remained online during the protests and played a major role. What's the risk in experimenting with blockchain? \"The risk is we go crazy, we have an unruly mess,\" Wolpert warned. \"[But] it's the Linux Foundation, we've been in this movie before. While there's a lot of really smart guys working on Bitcoin and startups, we've got equally amount of people who also have 20 or 30 years of experience with open source and open innovation, and I think we have a good shot at maintaining restraints, keeping it scoped down, keeping it simple, but getting it to something that is useful.\"</th>\n",

With more than 421,000 members in 260 countries, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) holding such a high-profile event has the potential to accelerate the rate of blockchain adoption by the engineering community. At the four-day conference, beginning Tuesday, the IEEE will host five blockchain seminars at the 702-year-old Exeter College of Oxford. The conference, IEEE Mobile Cloud 2016, is the organization's fourth annual event dedicated to mobile cloud computing services and engineering.

Computing shift While this looks to be the first IEEE conference to deal so closely with blockchain, its presence at an event dedicated to cloud computing is no surprise. 2016 is shaping up to be the year many stopped talking about bitcoin as a decentralized ledger and started talking about it as a database. Last month, IBM made a huge splash in the blockchain ecosystem when it announced among a wide range of other news, that it would be offering a wide range of blockchain-related initiatives. Further, in November, Microsoft coined the term Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) to describe its sandbox environment where developers could experiment with tools hosted on the company's Azure Cloud platform.

              "      <th>It will take time until banks come around to the idea of embracing Bitcoin or Fintech, though. Banks need to innovate at an accelerated pace, yet are unable to do so on their own. Allowing third-party developers to work together with the bank through API access would be a significant step in the right direction, as there is valuable input to be gathered from the Bitcoin and Fintech industries. Banks and other established financial players have not taken a liking to Fintech and digital currency just yet, as they see both industries as major competitors to their offerings. While it is certainly true Bitcoin and Fintech can bring significant improvements to the table, they should be seen as complementary allies who will bring success to the banking industry. Or that is what the Monetary Authority of Singapore seems to be thinking, at least. Also read: Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis For 03/28/2016 - Looking To Buy BTC? Embracing Bitcoin And Fintech As A Bank Is Necessary There is no denying the banking sector has seen very little to no real innovation for quite some time now, opening the door for other players to step in and offer something entirely different. In fact, a lot of financial experts see and as two major threats to the banking system, which would explain the vocal opposition to any solution that is not controlled by a bank or government. But the Monetary Authority of Singapore sees things different, as they feel both Fintech and Bitcoin are capable of complementing the current financial infrastructure, rather than be competing with banks. A combination of traditional banking with innovative technology and services has the potential to create a powerful and versatile financial ecosystem all over the globe. Fintech startups and entrepreneurs are renowned for thinking outside of the proverbial box when it comes to accessing financial services. Particularly where the money lending and peer-to-peer aspect is concerned, most Fintech companies have a leg up over their more traditional counterparts. But that does not mean these startups are looking to overthrow the banking system, although they might be able to in the long run. Any bank that is too slow - or simply unwilling - to innovate will be left behind in the long term, though. Collaborating with Fintech players is a far more preferable solution to this alternative, although it may involve swallowing some of the pride that are associated with the banking system. Fintech companies are, by design, more capable of embracing new and advanced technological features, which makes them invaluable allies for traditional banks. A Senior Regulator of the Monetary Authority of Singapore stated: \"MAS' approach to fintech is to use the power of technology to help banks to succeed. It's not a game of disruptors versus enablers. We see fintech as an enabler... The good news is fintech companies by design are creating far superior technology products, and where success lies is in partnering with banks, and enabling banks to succeed.\" But Bitcoin has a role to play in the financial world as well, although this system is completely outside of the control of banks and governments. Despite those barriers, the popular digital currency is available in every country in the world, allowing for frictionless and real-time transfers of value, regardless of previous access to financial services by consumers and businesses. So far, most of the major banks around the world have taking a page out of the Bitcoin playbook, by trying to develop their own blockchain technology solutions. But that is not all, as several countries are considering to issue their own digital currency, rather than embracing Bitcoin. Whether or not that will be the right decision, in the end, remains to be seen. It will take time until banks come around to the idea of embracing Bitcoin or Fintech, though. Banks need to innovate at an accelerated pace, yet are unable to do so on their own. Allowing third-party developers to work together with the bank through API access would be a significant step in the right direction as there is valuable input to be gathered from the Bitcoin and Fintech industries.</th>\n",
              "      <th>When most people think about computers and robots taking jobs away from humans, the images that usually come to mind are robots moving inventory around in an Amazon warehouse or McDonald's customers placing their order via a tablet instead of a cashier . But the robots are coming for much more sophisticated jobs as well. For example, blockchain technology is out to eat the lunches of some professionals in the traditional financial system. There's a Lot of Mistrust in the Banking System At a recent blockchain-focused event in Toronto, Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd was asked to explain the reasoning behind Wall Street's increased interest in blockchain technology. During his initial response, Todd pointed out some of the mistrust that exists in the current financial system: \"The dirty secret is [the banks] don't actually trust [their databases]. I mean, they don't trust their own employees. ... They don't trust each other. There's so many levels of mistrust here.\" Todd then discussed the massive industry built around financial audits. He noted: \"If they did trust all this stuff, why are there so many auditors? Why is there this massive infrastructure of labor-intensive human beings sitting there poring over transactions and trying to figure out where the money got created out of thin air. Where did the money disappear? Who moved what where? Was it all legit?\" Many financial institutions are interested in the concept of creating new systems for record-keeping, which would replace the current closed-ledger system with a more open alternative, similar to Bitcoin. Many believe this open system would enable more efficient and transparent auditing of financial activity. The Status Quo Is Doing All Right But It's Hard to Improve Todd also pointed out that financial institutions are already pretty good at what they do in terms of audits. He stated, \"For the most part, bank fraud is at tolerable levels, it seems.\" Todd noted that maintaining a proper history of financial activity is one of the issues with increasing the speed of settlement . Because audits are labor intensive and require man hours to complete, it's difficult to essentially come to consensus on the correct version of events in a nearly instantaneous manner. He added, \"The faster money can move around, the faster you could lose it all due to some hacker.\" How Does the Blockchain Help? Todd spoke on the perceived advantages of blockchains over the current way things work, which relies on placing trust in database admins and the people with the keys to the system. From this perspective, a blockchain simply looks like a strong audit log. Todd gave a specific example of how this technology can help: \"It could be something as simple as when I, as a bank employee, type something in, we really do want a cryptographic signature that's actually tied to my keycard or something. And that should go into a database. Well, what does that look like? It looks like a blockchain.\" The longtime Bitcoin researcher also pointed out that this is sort of what banks were already looking at doing before blockchain technology started to receive a lot of attention. He explained: \"I think where they're thinking of going naturally looks like blockchains, so when they hear all this blockchain stuff it's like, 'Oh yeah. This is roughly what we were looking at doing anyway.'\" Replacing Humans Is the Point At one point during the recent event in Toronto, Todd was asked if the trend is that blockchains will eventually replace human auditors. Todd responded: \"All this blockchain stuff is really about: How good can we make the security to get to the point where we can imagine getting rid of human beings?\" Indeed, Todd's comments appear to fit well with Satoshi Nakamoto 's original Bitcoin white paper . In the paper, Nakamoto stated: \"What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust....\" Going back further, cypherpunk Nick Szabo has written about the concept that third parties are security holes. In addition to improving security by cutting out trusted parties, financial institutions can cut costs by replacing human labor with computer code.

Are decentralized autonomous conglomerates the next logical step in this evolution? Ronny Boesing (RB): Without question, Decentralized Conglomerates are the next logical step. It should be noted that there will be Autonomous and Semi-Autonomous organizations that emerge. The difference being the level of organizational influence exerted over the universal platform. In an Autonomous Conglomerate, the contracts and workers would be completely independent of having any external influence or association with another entity, but may simply be using the same platform as another organization. In a Semi-Autonomous Conglomerate, there will be some level of external influence, support, or association with an official business. This means that an organization has special interest in the associated operations of the Conglomerate, and some semblance of top-down influence may occur. BC: What are the basic advantages of decentralized conglomerate over a centralized one like Google, for example? RB: A Decentralized Conglomerate allows organizations to join the forces of their communities on a universal platform that allows cross promotion and profit sharing, but does not force it. This paradigm also allows individual brand identities to flourish within the Conglomerate without having to worry about the interests of the Universal Platform conflicting with the interests of any given brand using the platform. In a traditional or even a digital conglomerate, the mission of the parent company guides the decisions of the subsidiaries. BC: Is anyone free to join such an online conglomerate community? RB: The system is agnostic, so that anyone who wants to create an asset for their organization or commodity has the capacity to do so. All tokens do not have equal risk, and some are far less risky than others to purchase. BC: Some could argue that MLM pyramid structured companies are also \"profit sharing\" communities, though this entails a lot of risk as we all know. What kind of risk is there for people choosing to enter and buy the digital tokens of a decentralized conglomerate or its constituents? RB: The risk of purchasing such tokens depends on many things, such as the market capitalization of the DC, the number of organizations connected to the DC, the capacity to exchange tokens for other forms of currency or products, the size of the reserve backing a given token. All tokens do not have equal risk, and some are far less risky than others to purchase. Everyone should do their due diligence to know how solid the infrastructure is behind any given token or DC. BC: Can't Bitcoin be considered the world's first decentralized conglomerate? RB: Bitcoin is not a conglomerate. It is a decentralized ledger. The only purpose of Bitcoin's blockchain was to keep track of transactions. Many organizations expanded upon the original protocol to create colored coins and languages that permitted applications to be built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. However, this was not the original intention of \"Bitcoin\" proper, and specifically talking about \"Bitcoin,\" it is apolitical, without special interest, and has no official organizational associations. [A decentralized conglomerate] was not the original intention of 'Bitcoin' proper, [...] it is apolitical, without special interest, and has no official organizational associations. Bitcoin is the world's first globally accepted currency that has no organizational associations, and that is simultaneously the best and worst aspect about it. Since there is no organization association, the problems that Bitcoin encounters rely on the community to come together and make a unilateral decision. As we have seen with the blocksize scaling issue , the transaction time debate , the recent DDoS attack, and the blockchain halt due to transaction costs; Bitcoin has some real problems that need to be addressed in order for it to be usable for enterprise scale organizations or countries alike. In that regard, since Bitcoin is apolitical, it doesn't really make logical sense for any country to switch to something which they have no control over as their main currency. So in that regard, Bitcoin is not only not a conglomerate, the apolitical aspect serves to keep organizations away from holding the currency during the fluctuations, as there is no real organization that has vested interest in keeping Bitcoin stable. BC: What exactly is OpenLedger's \"Bitcoin 3.0\" technology and what are Bitcoin's disadvantages compared to it when using it within the DC context? RB: As mentioned, Bitcoin has no associations. This means that the token can be purchased and amassed by any organization or country around the globe, leaving the token subject to wild swings due to margin trading. You see examples with organizations like Ether , Factom , or OpenLedger that have created a token that has organizational backing, and their respective tokens steadily increased in value instead of having wild unpredictable swings. Having an organization that has special interest in the Universal Ledger establishes a community and ecosystem which Bitcoin is lacking. It is the same type of culture that Apple has created using \"I\" branding that can be achieved with organizational associations. Bitcoin does not have this capacity. Having an organization that has special interest in the Universal Ledger establishes a community and ecosystem which Bitcoin is lacking. In order to get mass adoption or successful utilization, it is crucial to have a unified approach to the interface, and this becomes another major failing point of Bitcoin. Openledger has streamlined the UX/UI of digital currency transactions, and this represents a much more user-friendly approach with a smaller learning curve. Having development teams that can do research and development and then modify the UX based on user feedback is a great benefit that DC's have over Bitcoin. BC: Can you talk a little bit about the first partnerships between communities on this platform, namely OBITS and BitTeaser? RB: Every month, 70% of BitTeaser's monthly Bitcoin profits will be used to buyback BTSR and OBITS on the respective markets on OpenLedger. OBITS does it on the BTC (10%) and BTS (90%) market, and with BTSR it is done on BTS, BTC, USD and ETH markets 25% each. BTSR holders will receive 80% of this share, while OBITS holders will receive 20%. In the long term, BTSR holders may see an increase in the value per unit of their investment based on supply and demand, as well as having the tokens burned from every buyback thus reducing overall available supply. BitTeaser operates in a similar way to Google Adwords - revenue is generated based on providing advertising space for websites, companies and products. It currently serves over 1,000 webmasters, with monthly growth of around 15 to 20%. BC: Do they use smart-contracts to establish the terms? How is consensus achieved? RB: Yes, the system uses smart contracts to establish terms of service and reward. The consensus is achieved by third party confirmation that both sides have accomplished their respective tasks, whether it is putting money in escrow, or completing a contract request. BC: What was the approximate payout to the writers and bloggers using the platform? Will this amount increase as the overall platform grows? RB: At the last payment, some 11 BTC worth (currently around $4,500 USD) of BTSR and OBITS was sent to participating bloggers. That amount will increase as the network size and reach of the DC increases. OpenLedger has made it available for users to directly change tokens to USD, EUR, and CNY and have them directly deposited into their bank account. BC: How does the DC model interact with traditional fiat currency? Do users have to use an exchange to cash out their rewards? RB: \"In the same way that foreign currencies or bitcoin need to be exchanged before being used, any DC token will need to be changed to be used outside of the infrastructure. If an organization within the DC offers products or services that are desired, a direct purchase using a token could then be made without any exchange. Now, OpenLedger has made it available for users to directly change tokens to USD, EUR, and CNY and have them directly deposited into their bank account. No longer will a user have to have the hassle of going through an additional step of going to a bitcoin exchange to convert their smart money into fiat. Once a user has been validated he/she is prompted to attempt a withdrawal. Once the withdrawal request is made on OpenLedger for whatever currency is asked, the money is then sent to the user's bank account with a 3% withdrawal fee. Users can enjoy a fee-free deposit period that ends in August. [Note: Special thanks to Larry C. Bates, out of Bloomington, Indiana, the architect behind the great description of the DC, a good partner of OpenLedger and his assistance in giving answer to the questions.] Do you think decentralized conglomerates will change big business around the globe?

              "      <th>Ethereum, considered by many to be the most promising altcoin, has grabbed the attention of The New York Times. The \"newspaper of record\" has run a big feature story on Ethereum, noting its value has spiraled 1,000% in the last three months and is attracting interest from major financial companies that are using it for private blockchains and smart contracts. The story notes the first public version of Ethereum was recently released. The story noted there are numerous applications built on Ethereum that allow new ways to place bets, pay bills and even launch Ponzi schemes. Some cryptocurrency observers claim Ethereum will face more security issues than bitcoin due to its more complex software. The alt. currency system has faced less testing and suffered fewer attacks than bitcoin. The unusual design could also invite more regulatory scrutiny considering some potentially fraudulent contracts can be written into the system. Capabilities Draw Interest However, the system's capabilities have drawn interest from major corporations. Last year, IBM announced it was testing the alt.currency system as a way to manage real-world objects in the Internet of Things. Microsoft has been working on various projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its Azure computing cloud. Marley Gray, a business development and strategy director at Microsoft, said Ethereum is a platform for solving problems in different industries. He called it the most \"elegant\" solution seen to date. Private Blockchains Expand Many companies have created private blockchains using Ethereum. These private blockchains could eventually undermine the value of the Ether, the individual unit in the alt.currency system that people have been buying. Major banks have shown interest in using blockchains to make transferring and trading money more efficient. Several banks have examined how to use Ethereum. JPMorgan has developed a tool called Masala that enables its internal databases to interact with an Ethereum-blockchain. Michael Novogratz, who helped lead Fortress Investing Group invest in bitcoin, has been examining Ethereum since leaving Fortress last fall. He said he has made a significant purchase of Ether. Novogratz said in the last few months that the alt.currency is getting more validation. Ethereum Value Soars Ether's value has increased to as high as $12 from $1 since the beginning of the year, taking the value of all Ether currency to above $1 billion at times. This surpasses the value of any virtual currency besides bitcoin, which claimed more than $6 billion in value last week. Ethereum leads all altcoins in the size of its following One difference between Ethereum and bitcoin is that the latter came into being in a more transparent fashion. Where bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity remains a mystery, Ethereum was developed by Vitalik Buterin , a 21-year-old Russian, who created it after dropping out of Waterloo University in Ontario. Aim Was Smart Contracts Ethereum's basic aim was to make it possible to program agreements into the blockchain. This is the smart contract concept. Two people could, for instance, program a sport bet directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once a mutually-accepted source announced the final score (such as the Associated Press), the winnings would transfer automatically to the winner. Ether can be used as currency. Ether is also necessary to pay for the network power required to process the bet. Ethereum has been characterized as a single-shared computer operated by the network of users on which resources are doled out and paid for by Ether. Buterin's team raised $18 million through an Ether presale in 2014 to help fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the development of the software. Also read: Ether co-founder Vitalik Buterin on public and private blockchains Ethereum's Following Ethereum has attracted followers who have supported the software and hope that Ether will rise in value. There were 5,800 nodes, or computers, last week supporting the network. The bitcoin network had about 7,400 nodes. Joseph Lubin, a co-founder, established ConsenSys, which has hired more than 50 developers to create applications on the alt.currency system. One enables music distribution while another permits a new type of financial auditing. Lubin said he became interested in Ethereum after determining it delivered on some of bitcoin's failed promise, particularly when it came to permitting new types of online markets and contracts. He said Ethereum presented the crystallization of how to deliver on the broad strokes vision that bitcoin presented. Joseph Bonneau, a Stanford computer science researcher, said Ethereum is the first system that caught his interest since bitcoin. Ethereum is nonetheless far from a certainty, Bonneau said. He said bitcoin is still most likely the safest bet, with Ethereum number two. He said Ethereum's longevity will depend on real markets developing around it.

              "      <th>Every marketing channel suffers from fatigue at one stage. Whether this is due to an increase of competition, rising costs of competing or hitting a ceiling of volume, every business will face the challenge of seeing diminishing returns on a once high-performing channel for them. I've come across this challenge many times, which has made me very focused on adopting new channels that have potential at an early stage to reap the rewards. Just take video ads within Facebook as an example. We're currently at a point where video ads are reaching their peak; cost is still relatively low and engagement is high, but, like with most ad platforms, increased competition will drive up those prices and make it less and less viable for smaller companies (and larger ones) to invest in it. Being an early adopter of a new channel can provide enormous benefits, but that comes with equally high risks. This is amplified within marketplaces like Amazon. Early adopters within Amazon's marketplace were able to focus on building a solid base of reviews for their products - a primary ranking signal - which meant that they'd create huge barriers to entry for competitors (namely because they were always showing up in the search results before them). Every marketing channel suffers from fatigue at one stage. Whilst the payout wasn't huge within the early days of Amazon, those who got in early are now seeing huge rewards, with 38% of shoppers starting their buying journey within Amazon ( source ), making it the number one retail search engine. Some studies are suggesting that Amazon is responsible for 80% of e-commerce growth for publicly traded web retailers ( source ). On the other hand, early adoption can be somewhat of a curse. In 2011, many companies and individuals, myself included, invested a lot of time and money into Google+, dubbed to be bigger than Facebook at the time. They acquired over 10 million new users within the first two weeks of launch and things were looking positive. Many companies doubled-down on growing a community within the platform, hopeful of using it as a new and growing acquisition channel, but things didn't exactly pan out that way . Google all but killed the social network in mid-2015 leaving a lot of early adopters licking their wounds. Life Beyond Email For as long as I can remember, email has been a fundamentally important channel for a large majority of businesses. The ability to market products directly through a channel that scales up to an incredibly high ceiling is very attractive. The only problem is that it's costing more and more money to acquire email addresses from potential customers, and the engagement from email is getting worse and worse. As the above chart ( source ) illustrates, email click-rate has been steadily declining. Whilst open rates seem to be increasing - largely driven by mobile - the actual engagement from email is nosediving. Not only that, but it's becoming more and more difficult to even reach someone's email inbox; Google's move to separate out promotional emails into their 'promotions' tab and increasing problems of email deliverability have been top reasons behind this. All that said, email is still an incredibly important channel for a lot of businesses and it undoubtedly still gets results. I don't think many people will argue that, whilst this is the case now, things are only going to get worse. As with many 'organic' channels, the relative reach of your audience tends to decline over time due to a variety of factors. In email's case, it can be the over-exposure to marketing emails and moves from email providers to filter out promotional content; with other channels it can be the platform itself. Back in 2014 I wrote about how \" Facebook's Likes Don't Matter Anymore \" in relation to the declining organic reach of Facebook pages. Last year alone the organic reach of publishers on Facebook fell by a further 52% . Subscribe via Messenger The Birth of Chatbots It's fair to say that I'm pretty obsessed with chatbots right now. There are some great applications popping up from brands that genuinely add value to the end consumer, and early signs are showing that consumers are actually responding really well to them. For those of you who aren't quite sure what I'm talking about, here's a quick overview of what a chatbot is: A chatbot is a service powered by rules, and sometimes artificial intelligence, that you interact with via a chat interface. The service could be any number of things, ranging from functional to fun, and it could live in any major chat product (Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Text Messages, etc.). ( source ) Awareness around chatbots is starting to grow, especially after Facebook came out mid-last year with their new Messenger platform that supported chatbots. On top of that, and like with a lot of things online, the adult industry has stimulated a lot of demand around chatbots. Just take a look at some of the most searched-for keywords in the search engines related to chatbots (data from Storybase ): This is why we can't have nice things. That aside, there are some really great chatbots that have been built that add a bunch of value whilst also benefitting the brand commercially. One that I really like is the Politico chatbot that gives you regular digests of news whilst also serving you up relevant information that you ask for. This is great for the consumer because they don't need to leave the environment of Facebook to get access to the content they want, and it's hugely beneficial to Politico, as they're able to push on-demand content through to an increasingly engaged audience - oh, and they can also learn a bunch of interesting things about their audience in the process (I'll get to this shortly). There are a bunch of e-commerce stores taking advantage of chatbots as well. One example that I was playing with was from Fynd that enables you to ask for specific products and they'll display them to you directly within Messenger. What's more, Facebook even allows you to make payments via Messenger bots , opening up a whole world of possibility to e-commerce stores. Bot experiences with more engaged audiences are getting 80-90% response rates. I spoke with Dmitriy Kachin from Chatfuel, a chatbot creation platform, to see how some of their customers' chatbots were performing in terms of read/response rates. Here's what he had to say: \" Obviously, numbers vary across the board - and better bot experiences with more engaged audiences are getting 80-90% response rates. While even the least favorable experiences are in the 35-40% range. \" Why Should You Care? Ok, so you're probably thinking, \"This all sounds great, Matt, but how can I do something with chatbots?\" Well, I've got you covered. Don't for a minute think that chatbots are some gimmick that is going to be available only to bring brands with huge audiences. Whilst there are a number of new chatbots appearing each week, the space is still in its infancy. This is the time to become an early adopter. Why? Here are five reasons to start with (and this is just with Messenger): As soon as someone engages with your chatbot, you have the ability to push messages to them within Facebook Messenger with very few limitations. You can use input from users to dynamically segment them into groups and serve different content to them. You can set up automation workflows in the same way that you would via email marketing automation. Click-through rates and general engagement is very high at this stage. You're more likely to get engagement within Messenger than from within your Facebook page because the communication is 1:1 and you're not competing with others in the newsfeed. Facebook has opened up the ability to run ads directly to Messenger . This means that anyone that engages with your ad can now be followed up with directly within Messenger (this is incredibly exciting). The fact that you can now run ads directly to Messenger is an enormous opportunity for any business. This skips the convoluted and leaky process of trying to acquire someone's email address to nurture them outside of Facebook's platform. Instead, you can retain the connection with someone inside Facebook and improve the overall conversion rates to receiving an engagement. Don't forget that you can also tap into platforms outside of Messenger as well, for example, Slack, Telegram and even SMS. If you're interested in bringing a chatbot to a whole bunch of these different platforms then I'd recommend checking out Flow XO . Subscribe via Messenger How Do I Create a Chatbot? One of the biggest hurdles to overcome with being an early adopter of a platform is that it often costs a lot of money and requires highly specialized skills. That's not the case with chatbots. You can actually go from an idea to a fully functioning chatbot within a matter of minutes, and it won't cost you anything. How is this possible? Chatfuel . Chatfuel is a platform that lets you build your own Chatbot for Messenger (and Telegram) for free. The only limit is if you pass more than 100,000 conversations per month, but for most businesses that won't be an issue. No understanding of code is required and it has a simple drag-and-drop interface. Think Wix/Squarespace for bots ( side note : I have zero affiliation with Chatfuel). There are other platforms similar to Chatfuel at the moment, but not many. Botsify is one, but I haven't actually used them yet. The first thing to do when mapping out your own chatbot is to figure out what unique value it could add to the user. One example of a chatbot that I'm testing out at the minute is a recipe recommendation bot that lives directly within Messenger. The basic way that it works will be that the user will say what ingredient (or list of a few ingredients) that they want to cook with and the chatbot will serve up relevant recipe recommendations. It's a simple idea but adds a ton of ongoing value to the user, and, more importantly, gives them a reason to regularly engage with the bot. This creates a bunch of opportunities to take the user down extra conversion paths - for example, purchasing ingredients, product recommendations and ongoing content subscriptions (to name a few). When you're thinking about designing your chatbot you should have a very clear answer to \"Why would someone continue to get value from this?\" Chatfuel Basics: Blocks and Rules The basic way that Chatfuel works is by linking \"blocks\" to \"AI Rules\". The best way to explain this is in the same context of email automation. Think of the \"blocks\" as individual emails, and the \"AI Rules\" as your automation rules (i.e., if a user does x , send them y ). Each interaction that you plan to make with the user should be built out in an individual block. Based on the user's input, they will receive different blocks afterwards. Here's a simple schematic of how a user would interact with individual \"blocks\" within my recipe recommendation example: This is an extremely simplified version of the interaction flow, but it should hopefully illustrate the basic premise behind \"blocks\". The rules can be set up so that if a user responds in a certain way, they'll be served a specific block. For example, in the flow I've outlined above, if a user says, \"No\" when asked if they want to see another recipe for the ingredient they specified, they'll be directed back to the \"Select Ingredient\" block. You can also create some rules based on keywords. For example, if a user types the words \"manage subscription\", you could send them to a block that asks them if they'd like to reduce the amount of messages they receive. This is one of many examples. In my recipe recommendation example, if a user types \"salmon recipes\" they'll be served up a selection of recipes that include salmon. This can be pulled in dynamically via the RSS plugin within Chatfuel. The plugin aspect to Chatfuel is one of the real bonuses. You can link up to all sorts of different services to add richer content to the conversations that you're having. This includes linking up to Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, as well as being able to request that the user share their location, serve video and audio content, and build out custom attributes that can be used to segment users based on their inputs. This last part is a killer feature. My advice here is to go in and create a free account with Chatfuel and just start playing around. They have a really useful \"Test This Chatbot\" feature that pings you a message in Messenger to start engaging with your bot in development mode so that you can test it out and improve it before going live. Using Chatbots to Grow Your Funnel Once you've started to get some engagement with your chatbot, you can start experimenting with a bunch of different ways to use it as an acquisition channel. Here are a few ideas that can get you started with understanding how to apply chatbots in a way that can grow your funnel. Some of these will apply directly to your business, whilst others will be less relevant. I'll be sharing more new ideas over time. Newsletter Opt-In Discount Code Content Upgrades Lining Up Meetings During my conversation with Dmitriy Kachin from Chatfuel, I asked him for some tips on getting the best possible results from broadcast messages. From analyzing Chatfuel's customer data, Dmitriy came back with the following: The overall quality of the content and its relevance to the audience the bot owner is reaching out to. Giving people a clear and precise expectation of what you will be sending, how often, and offering them the opportunity to choose whether they want to receive this type of content and how frequently. Give the users as much control as possible. Being mindful not to abuse the power of broadcasting (no more than 2 broadcast messages per day typically); otherwise, people start getting annoyed with the volume of messages and tend to unsubscribe, or mute the bot. Personalizing the content as much as possible - making use of FB's default user attributes (addressing users by name), using the segmentation features of the platform to learn as much as possible about the audience and offering specific groups of people only the type of content that is relevant to their needs, interests and choices. Final Thoughts If you're a subscriber to my email list or a regular follower of my blog then you'll likely hear me talking a lot about chatbots over the coming months. I've personally been testing them out a lot and plan to do a whole lot more - some of you will have received used my chatbot as part of my 'free SEO consultation' campaign. Ultimately, only time will tell how effective the likes of Facebook Messenger will become in the long term. As more and more companies look to use chatbots within the platform, the greater the frequency of messages that individual users will receive. This could result in Facebook (and other messaging platforms) placing stricter restrictions on usage, but until then I'd recommend testing as much as possible. If you're running a chatbot that's seen some success, I'd love to hear from you in the comments below. Subscribe via Messenger</th>\n",
              "      <th>Existing mechanisms for file sharing are so fragmented that people waste time on multi-step copying and repackaging. With the new project Upspin, we aim to improve the situation by providing a global name space to name all your files. Given an Upspin name, a file can be shared securely, copied efficiently without \"download\" and \"upload\", and accessed by anyone with permission from anywhere with a network connection. Our target audience is personal users, families, or groups of friends. Although Upspin might have application in enterprise environments, we think that focusing on the consumer case enables easy-to-understand and easy-to-use sharing. File names begin with the user's email address followed by a slash-separated Unix-like path name: ann@example.com/dir/file. Any user with appropriate permission can access the contents of this file by using Upspin services to evaluate the full path name, typically via a FUSE filesystem so that unmodified applications just work. Upspin names usually identify regular static files and directories, but may point to dynamic content generated by devices such as sensors or services. If the user wishes to share a directory (the unit at which sharing privileges are granted), she adds a file called Access to that directory. In that file she describes the rights she wishes to grant and the users she wishes to grant them to. For instance, read: joe@here.com, mae@there.com allows Joe and Mae to read any of the files in the directory holding the Access file, and also in its subdirectories. As well as limiting who can fetch bytes from the server, this access is enforced end-to-end cryptographically, so cleartext only resides on Upspin clients, and use of cloud storage does not extend the trust boundary. Upspin looks a bit like a global file system, but its real contribution is a set of interfaces, protocols, and components from which an information management system can be built, with properties such as security and access control suited to a modern, networked world. Upspin is not an \"app\" or a web service, but rather a suite of software components, intended to run in the network and on devices connected to it, that together provide a secure, modern information storage and sharing network. Upspin is a layer of infrastructure that other software and services can build on to facilitate secure access and sharing. This is an open source contribution, not a Google product. We have not yet integrated with the Key Transparency server, though we expect to eventually, and for now use a similar technique of securely publishing all key updates. File storage is inherently an archival medium without forward secrecy; loss of the user's encryption keys implies loss of content, though we do provide for key rotation. It's early days, but we're encouraged by the progress and look forward to feedback and contributions. To learn more, see the GitHub repository at upspin .</th>\n",

              "      <th>Introduction I've talked previously about my initial experience with MacOS. While I still love the laptop and how well it works, my favourite applications in it have very little to do with Apple's ecosystem - Most of them are command-line application that are shared with most of the UNIX/Linux world. Adopting the terminal for most of my interactions allows me to be a lot more productive - I can work on multiple projects, tasks and easily switch contexts and folders. Below are some of my currently favourite CLI applications. zsh / oh-my-zsh zsh is an alternative to bash, it comes with multiple features that enhance the general usage of the terminal. These are the ones I find myself constantly using: More practical auto-complete - Visual and arrows-navigable auto-complete Auto-complete directories from a single letter - Complete directories like cd ~/d/y and take you directly to cd ~/Downloads/YouTube Go back to your directory history with cd - Auto complete in git- Jump between branches with a quick tab Besides the core functionality of zsh, there are plenty of plugins to choose from. history-substring-search allows you to start typing a command, and then press up to search for all the commands that start that way. If you find your colours to be too dull, install syntax-highlighting plugin. Now you can spot the syntax error before running the command: And just to make your terminal a bit prettier, there is the powerful prompt. Besides being pretty it allows you to see easily your current git status and branch. Here is what mine looks like: Copying output to clipboard (without a mouse) Part of the advantages of using the terminal, is that you don't need a mouse... Until you need to copy something. Here are some options for mouse-less copying. yank With yank all you need to copy something is redirect its output to it, like so: pbcopy (MacOS) / xclip (Linux) Both of these commands would copy the content that was piped to them: iTerm2 integration iTerm2 has plenty of features to make it my favorite terminal shell. Its integration feature allows you, among many other things , to easily select and copy the output of the last command: fasd One of my first pains when working in the command-line was: \"How do I get to my project folder? Surely writing cd ~/my/very/long/path will get old very quickly?\". Luckily fasd can help with that (and more). Once installed and configured, it listens silently as you cd to various folders. As soon as you do, however, it remembers its path and allows you to do it much faster next time. In the example below, I go to a directory manually. Then to go back to it, I just use fasd's z command and switch back. Beside changing directories, you can also use fasd's shortcuts for other operations using the comma (,) command, e.g: lnav I find lnav to be one of the best ways to cope with log files. The fact that it is also in CLI just makes it easier to work with. It effortlessly loads a single file or a whole folder with multiple log files, and allows you to filter, search and follow it very swiftly. Here I open a folder in lnav, with many log files, and filter to get the specific lines I want: peco peco is used to quickly filter the output of commands. Consider it to be the interactive version of grep . For example, let's search inside my command line history to remind me syntax of git merge-base : Note that peco returned the selected line - That means you can use it with other applications. For example, let's get the pid of Evernote to the clipboard with the aforementioned yank : tig I've started using git with a proper GUI client. As time progressed, however, I found the terminal to be faster and better for many of the common operations: checkout/pull/merge. However, some of the operations do require interactivity. When I view git's log I would like to move freely between commits and when committing, I'd like to be able to select the files I'd like to stage. Using a proper GUI client for that, however, is distracting - It breaks you out of the terminal and breaks the flow of the regular commands. tig helps you with that. git log To watch the history, just run tig in the directory - You will be able to view each commit, affected files and the relevant diff. git commit By running tig status it is easy to stage the files you'd like to commit, or even specific lines (chunks) git difftool Just because you're in text mode and specifically tig, doesn't mean you have to rely on text-mode diff. If you're a fan of a proper diff/merge tool (e.g. Beyond Compare) it is easy to configure tig to open one. Simply add the following to your .tigrc file: Now simply select a changed file and press F4 ranger Even if you're comfortable with the terminal, some actions can still be a chore. Quickly exploring multiple directories, copying multiple by selection to another folder, etc. As a short example, here is how I would copy some files with ranger : realpath What do you do if you need to provide a certain file in the terminal to an open GUI application? For example, if you want to get the path of a photo to your photo editing program? You could do pwd , to get the current directory, and then append to it the name of file. But there's an easier way. realpath gives you the real, absolute path of any file, like so: mackup So you got your applications configured. What will happen once your computer dies or gets replaced? mackup (for both MacOS and Linux) is a really simple way to backup your configurations to Dropbox, or another cloud storage. Its method is ingenious -instead of making copies and schedules, all it does is simply copies the file once to your Dropbox and replaces the original with the symlink. The applications continue working with their configurations as usual, but they are actually modifying them on your Dropbox. Now every configuration change you do is immediately back-upped by your cloud storage. It's worth to emphasize - Unlike other backup applications, you only run mackup once . Tell me about yours! Hub  - Avoid going to GitHub for pull requests and forks! Perform most of GitHub's operations from the comfort of the command line. Tmux  - A multiplexer for the terminal, really useful if you work on a remote computer and would like to work with multiple tabs, panes and disconnect without closing your environment and processes. Fzf  - Fuzzy finder, similiar to peco. While at it, you might also want to check fzy . There are quite a few others too, though, I am not sure what's the difference. Mdlt  - A calculator for the command line that can also integrate and derive. I would be happy to hear about your favorite command line applications and how you use them.

              "      <th>February 9, 2017 - We begin each year with a look at the K-12 computer science landscape - whether the direct impact of Code.org and our partners, or the indirect and sometimes unrelated impact of other global efforts that share our vision. It's been three and a half years since Code.org hired our first employee. We've been humbled to watch the world's education system embrace computer science, at an ever-accelerating pace. During this short time, 11 countries, 31 U.S. states, and over 120 U.S. cities and school districts have announced efforts to expand access to computer science as part of the K-12 curriculum; the new Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course has launched in over 2,000 classrooms; over 50,000 U.S. teachers have attended workshops to begin teaching computer science; over 500,000 teachers globally have begun teaching computer science classes to over 16 million students; diversity in computer science classrooms has improved for two years in a row; the Hour of Code has surpassed 350 million served - reaching one out of every 10 students on the planet; and 8 Presidents and Prime Ministers have hosted events to inspire millions more to join this teacher-powered movement. To be clear, this isn't the work of Code.org alone. We've had the support of hundreds of partners , and hundreds of thousands of educators, globally. Many of them began this work years before we existed. The international momentum is led by partners who share our mission in other countries. And in the U.S., this movement has had the bipartisan support of the federal government as well as most state governments. Our largest donors - Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Infosys, and Omidyar Network - deserve special recognition for funding not only Code.org but also the other nonprofits working towards the same goal, globally. We are thankful for all the efforts that share our mission. When we launched Code.org in 2013, it seemed impossible to change the entire education system. Although we still have a long way to go, 2016 was yet another record year, making us more confident than ever in our ability to realize our vision - that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science. Inspire students and increase diversity with the Hour of Code 20 million served 90M 48% female 195M 49% female 344M 49% female Enable students to show \"basic coding proficiency\" with CS Fundamentals. N/A N/A N/A 887,840 total 365,842 female Improve diversity in CS (measured among students on Code Studio) N/A 43% female, 37% African American or Hispanic 43% female, 37% African American or Hispanic 45% female, 48% underrepresented minorities , 47% free/reduced meal plans Lead a coalition to set policies supporting CS. Policies changed in: 5 states 16 states 17 states, including $9M in CS funding 31 states , including $13M in CS funding Addressing diversity in K-12 computer science is core to our mission. We all know the technology sector as a whole has a diversity problem , caused by a variety of factors. Our focus is on one piece of the problem, the education pipeline, where historically only 20~25% of students are female, and 13~15% are underrepresented minorities. By contrast, the students across Code.org classrooms are far more balanced across gender, race, and also socioeconomic status. This is partly because teachers integrate our courses into classrooms that are already diverse, and partly because we incorporate a focus on diversity throughout our work . For example, we published a study of 8,000 students who took a survey right before and after trying our tutorials. Among female high school students, the number who agreed with the statement \"I like computer science\" jumped from 55% to 75% from just one session of using Code.org's Hour of Code activities. As another example, consider our Computer Science Principles course, designed for the new AP Computer Science exam. Traditionally, AP Computer Science is dominated by white and Asian males, with at most 15% underrepresented minorities. In our 512 classrooms, 49% of the students are underrepresented minorities - which adds up to more students than the entire nation's AP computer science exam participation in 2016. (Side note: 53% of Code.org's staff are women. Our board and leadership team are gender-balanced.) In the 3 years since we launched our Code Studio coding platform, 1/10 of all students on the planet have engaged in our computer science courses, making Code Studio the most broadly used curriculum in computer science. Of course, millions of these students are \"drive-by\" users. What matters more to us is how many teachers incorporate our lessons into their classrooms, and what their students learn. Example high school classroom project, using turtle-drawing commands Measuring by registered students, registered teachers, or monthly activity, Code Studio has doubled in scale in the last 12 months. But instead of measuring logins or page-views, in the last year, we embarked on creating a new metric of success. We began counting students who demonstrate \"basic coding proficiency\" in our CS Fundamentals course using a definition which we created based on student success at coding challenges. The chart below shows how many students demonstrated this proficiency at different levels of difficulty. (This is our first stab at measuring student proficiency, and we have a lot of work to improve it.) The secret behind our growth is simple: teachers recommend our courses to other teachers. One way to measure this is with the Net Promoter methodology : we score 85 among teachers, which is outstanding. This high score is supported by the testimonials we hear from teachers in classrooms. In the 2016-17 school year, we formally launched our App Lab app-making tool, and began scaling our new College Board endorsed Computer Science Principles course to prepare for a new AP exam. Computer science is already the fastest-growing AP course offered by the College Board, having almost doubled since Code.org launched. With this year's new exam, 2017 is poised to be its biggest year yet. There are 2,600 schools participating in the new exam, according to the College Board audit. Among schools using College Board endorsed curricula, 55% are using Code.org's CS Principles course. More than 75,000 students have interacted with our CS Principles course this school year. Our focus is the 512 classrooms of teachers in our professional learning program. These classrooms have 18,615 students enrolled, of which 5,721 are female students, and 9,083 are underrepresented minorities. If these students all take the exam, we have the opportunity to double the number of underrepresented minorities in AP computer science in just one year. In 2016 Code.org's professional learning and school outreach programs accelerated in every dimension. We hosted 4 large professional learning conferences for educators, with stellar feedback. And we grew our network of regional partners and expert facilitators - this network will provide the backbone for the future growth of K-12 computer science. 52,000 computer science teachers prepared by Code.org Our professional learning network: over 40 regional partners, 400 expert facilitators And above all, across all our programs, we passed a new milestone: 52,000 computer science teachers have been prepared by Code.org. Most of these are elementary school teachers who will begin teaching 10-20 hours of computer science per year. But thousands of them are high school teachers teaching a year-long computer science class. More importantly, the feedback from our professional learning workshops is uniformly fantastic. The vast majority of teachers attending these workshops rank them the \"best professional development\" they've ever experienced. This is partly because America's teachers want to learn and teach computer science, and partly because of the amazing passion of our expert facilitators. While most of Code.org's staff and resources are focused on implementing computer science programs in schools, we have a small, crack team working on changing government policies to support, expand, and sustain K-12 computer science. This effort wouldn't be possible without our coalition partners (especially Microsoft and the College Board), and our many local champions deserve the real credit for driving local change. Our state policy work focuses on 9 ideas we urge every state to consider . Below, we highlight our impact across 3 of these that are easiest to measure. Policy area Policy changed since 2013 High school graduation policy States that have changed policies to allow rigorous CS courses to satisfy core high school graduation requirements AL, AZ, AR, CA, CO, FL, ID, IL, KY, LA, MD, MN, NH, NJ, NY, OH, PA, TN, VA, WA, WV, WI Establishing state-level standards for CS States that have developed or are in the process of developing state education standards for computer science AR, CA, CO, FL, ID, IN, MA, NJ, SC, TX, VA, WA, WI, and WV. States that are evaluating developing standards: AL, DE, MD, MT, OK, and RI. Funding for CS States that have allocated funding specifically to K-12 computer science AR, AZ, GA, ID, MA, RI, UT, VA, WA. These states have allocated $13.01M in total Throughout 2016 we saw growing momentum for computer science among local governments beyond just the policy measures listed above. Chicago Public Schools became the first major school district to make computer science a graduation requirement for all students. The US Conference of Mayors proposed a resolution (sponsored by the mayors of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Baltimore) to expand computer science in schools. Last but not least, we launched the Governors for CS partnership, bringing together the governors of Arkansas, Washington, Rhode Island, Iowa, Virginia, Idaho, and Nevada to build plans for K-12 computer science with more governors to join in 2017. After over a year of work by fourteen states and four school districts, dozens of writers and advisors, and leaders in corporate, nonprofit, and education sectors, the K-12 Computer Science Framework was launched in October with broad support . The framework offers a set of guidelines that could be used to inform the development of standards, curriculum, and computer science pathways, and also help school systems build capacity for teaching computer science. The impact of all the experts and organizations who came together to create the Framework will be felt for years to come. In December, we hosted 22 state teams to plan implementation work, and we will continue similar convenings to build on the momentum. In addition, in 2016, ETS announced it will create a new Praxis exam for credentialing teachers in computer science, and Pearson is working on a similar exam - both informed by the Framework. 2016 was the biggest year ever for the Hour of Code , which has now surpassed 350 million \"served.\" This year, Code.org handed important reins of the campaign to the education community: We gave a committee and review board the responsibility of setting the guidelines and rating the recommended activities . Hundreds of global nonprofits, corporations, and government agencies supported the campaign. From the new tutorials launched by Disney, Microsoft, and Google, to the activities and promotions hosted at Facebook offices and Apple stores, to the thousands of industry volunteers from other companies, the collaboration was amazing. Our own web site hummed along more smoothly than ever, thanks to the support of Amazon Web Services. The global campaign was launched by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . And the world's greatest athletes supported this year's Hour of Code with a special inspirational video for students. Presidents and prime ministers rally around the Hour of Code Eight presidents and prime ministers around the world have now hosted symbolic events to inspire students and educators to try computer science. The global Hour of Code campaign has established Computer Science Education Week as a fixture in hundreds of thousands of schools, each year recruiting tens of millions of new students and hundreds of thousands of teachers to try computer science. The work of our global partners has also helped build global momentum for computer science. In 2016, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Ireland, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia followed the lead set by UK, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Australia, and Italy to announce plans to integrate computer science into national curriculum. (See status of global CS efforts ) Last but certainly not least, the biggest headline in computer science in 2016 was the Obama administration's announcement of Computer Science for All . The President announced that \"in the new economy, computer science isn't an optional skill, it's a basic skill.\" The announcement was coupled with a $4 billion proposal for Federal funding. Although the headline funding of CS for All didn't pan out, the bully pulpit played an important role to accelerate this movement. The White House helped amplify and celebrate the work of the computer science community, and President Obama's personal support for Code.org has been invaluable to the movement's international growth. Local efforts such as CS4RI , CS4NH , CS4TX have sprung up in response and will serve as new rallying cries for the movement. Meanwhile, Congress unanimously authorized long-term NSF funding for computer science research which has provided foundational guidance and support to many efforts in the space. NSF funding has established new CS courses in hundreds of classrooms: 5~10% of all new CS teachers prepared this decade were funded by the NSF, and ~19% of all AP CS Principles teachers are teaching NSF-funded curricula. We're thankful to the bipartisan leadership of the Representatives and Senators who supported continuing this work. Of course, together with the new CS Education Coalition , we will continue advocating for federal funding for computer science. Although most of the last few years' progress to expand computer science in U.S. schools have been funded by private donors and state governments, an injection of federal funding would greatly accelerate these efforts. Code.org recently penned a memo for the Trump administration laying out a very simple case: In 2016, Fortune 500 CEOs, 27 governors, and top education leaders joined forces to call for federal funding to address this. In 2017, thanks to the leadership of champions from both parties, we are as hopeful as ever that this goal is within reach. With yet another year of growth, we are more confident than ever in the strength and momentum behind the computer science movement, not just in the United States, but globally. Hundreds of thousands of worldwide educators have decided that every student in every school deserves the opportunity to learn computer science. The strength of this movement lies in the inspirational commitment of these teachers and educators. The nonprofits, philanthropists, and local governments who support them will continue and even accelerate our work in 2017 and beyond.

              "      <th>At JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., a learning machine is parsing financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours. The program, called COIN, for Contract Intelligence, does the mind-numbing job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that, until the project went online in June, consumed 360,000 hours of lawyers' time annually. The software reviews documents in seconds, is less error-prone and never asks for vacation. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg While the financial industry has long touted its technological innovations, a new era of automation is now in overdrive as cheap computing power converges with fears of losing customers to startups. Made possible by investments in machine learning and a new private cloud network, COIN is just the start for the biggest U.S. bank. The firm recently set up technology hubs for teams specializing in big data, robotics and cloud infrastructure to find new sources of revenue, while reducing expenses and risks. The push to automate mundane tasks and create new tools for bankers and clients -- a growing part of the firm's $9.6 billion technology budget -- will be a theme as the company hosts its annual investor day on Tuesday. Behind the strategy, overseen by Chief Operating Operating Officer Matt Zames and Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy, is an undercurrent of anxiety: Though JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as one of few big winners, its dominance is at risk unless it aggressively pursues new technologies, according to interviews with a half-dozen bank executives. Redundant Software That was the message Zames had for Deasy when he joined the firm from BP Plc in late 2013. The New York-based bank's internal systems, an amalgam from decades of mergers, had too many redundant software programs that didn't work together seamlessly. \"Matt said, 'Remember one thing above all else: We absolutely need to be the leaders in technology across financial services,'\" Deasy said last week in an interview. \"Everything we've done from that day forward stems from that meeting.\" A QuickTake explainer on fintech After visiting companies including and three years ago to understand how their developers worked, the bank set out to create its own computing cloud called Gaia that went online last year. Machine learning and big-data efforts now reside on the private platform, which effectively has limitless capacity to support their thirst for processing power. The system already is helping the bank automate some coding activities and making its 20,000 developers more productive, saving money, Zames said. When needed, the firm can also tap into outside cloud services from , and . Tech Spending JPMorgan will make some of its cloud-backed technology available to institutional clients later this year, allowing firms like to access balances, research and trading tools. The move, which lets clients bypass salespeople and support staff for routine information, is similar to one announced in 2015. JPMorgan's total technology budget for this year amounts to 9 percent of its projected revenue -- double the industry average, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck. The dollar figure has inched higher as JPMorgan bolsters cyber defenses after a 2014 data breach, which exposed the information of 83 million customers. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg One-third of the budget is for new initiatives, a figure Zames wants to take to 40 percent in a few years. He expects savings from automation and retiring old technology will let him plow even more money into new innovations. Not all of those bets, which include several projects based on a distributed ledger, like blockchain, will pay off, which JPMorgan says is OK. One example executives are fond of mentioning: The firm built an electronic platform to help trade credit-default swaps that sits unused. 'Can't Wait' \"We're willing to invest to stay ahead of the curve, even if in the final analysis some of that money will go to product or a service that wasn't needed,\" Marianne Lake, the lender's finance chief, told a conference audience in June. That's \"because we can't wait to know what the outcome, the endgame, really looks like, because the environment is moving so fast.\" As for COIN, the program has helped JPMorgan cut down on loan-servicing mistakes, most of which stemmed from human error in interpreting 12,000 new wholesale contracts per year, according to its designers. JPMorgan is scouring for more ways to deploy the technology, which learns by ingesting data to identify patterns and relationships. The bank plans to use it for other types of complex legal filings like credit-default swaps and custody agreements. Someday, the firm may use it to help interpret regulations and analyze corporate communications. Another program called X-Connect, which went into use in January, examines e-mails to help employees find colleagues who have the closest relationships with potential prospects and can arrange introductions. Creating Bots For simpler tasks, the bank has created bots to perform functions like granting access to software systems and responding to IT requests, such as resetting an employee's password, Zames said. Bots are expected to handle 1.7 million access requests this year, doing the work of 140 people. Photographer: Kholood Eid/Bloomberg While growing numbers of people in the industry worry such advancements might someday take their jobs, many Wall Street personnel are more focused on benefits. A survey of more than 3,200 financial professionals by recruiting firm Options Group last year found a majority expect new technology will improve their careers, for example by improving workplace performance. Click here for Options Group's survey on technology's impact \"Anything where you have back-office operations and humans kind of moving information from point A to point B that's not automated is ripe for that,\" Deasy said. \"People always talk about this stuff as displacement. I talk about it as freeing people to work on higher-value things, which is why it's such a terrific opportunity for the firm.\" To help spur internal disruption, the company keeps tabs on 2,000 technology ventures, using about 100 in pilot programs that will eventually join the firm's growing ecosystem of partners. For instance, the bank's machine-learning software was built with , a software firm that JPMorgan first encountered in 2009. \"We're starting to see the real fruits of our labor,\" Zames said. \"This is not pie-in-the-sky stuff.\"</th>\n",
